      "**Title**: Great hotel with the best animation team\n",
      "**Text**: The Nour Palace hotel met all my expectations. And above all, the expectations of my five-year-old son. The greatest credit for this goes to the animation team. It is impossible to mention them all by name, but each one of them tries their best and takes care of the guests in the best possible way. I could easily leave my son with them and swim at the same time. They are open, speak different languages and always meet the guests' needs. My son had the best relationship with Sarra, but the rest also try very hard. And even when they are tired, they do not show it. I thank them very much for everything. Mouna is also very nice, she takes care of the hotel-guest relationship. The meals are varied. Everyone will find something delicious for themselves. The hotel is not the youngest but it is maintained in really good condition. Rooms are in good shape. The beach is sandy, large swimming pool and great slides. I highly recommend it to all those who are undecided.  \n",

      "Okay, based on your preference for a quiet place with no animation and the information I have about Nour Palace, here's my recommendation:\n",
      "\n",
      "**I would advise against choosing Nour Palace for your trip.**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Nour Palace is a 5-star resort with many appealing amenities, the overwhelming feedback from recent reviews highlights a strong focus on animation and entertainment. Many guests specifically praise the animation team and the variety of evening entertainment. This suggests that the hotel has a lively atmosphere, which is the opposite of what you're looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the hotel is described as having a \"Quiet\" hotel style, the reviews indicate that this is not the primary experience for most guests. The presence of a water park, kids club, and nightclub/DJ further reinforces the idea that Nour Palace caters more towards families and those seeking an active, engaging vacation rather than a tranquil retreat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, to ensure you have a relaxing and quiet vacation without constant animation, I recommend exploring alternative hotels that are specifically marketed as adults-only or quiet resorts. These types of hotels are designed to provide a peaceful and serene environment, free from the noise and activities associated with family-oriented entertainment.\n",
