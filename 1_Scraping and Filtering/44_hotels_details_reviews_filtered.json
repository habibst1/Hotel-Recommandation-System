Reception staff very friendly.  At the lobby bar, Mahrez was amazing and helpful.  Also a shout out to Khaled in the breakfast dining room.  Knew my coffee order and brought it to me every morning.  The reason I gave four stars out of five, are the on site restaurants.  If you like fish/seafood, you’ll be very happy.  For those of us that are vegetarian, not many good choices.  I felt the menu in the lobby bar had more choices at better prices.  Not within walking distance to the Medina,  The hotel arrange for a taxi to drive us and wait for us.  Overall, a pleasant stay."

It's a shame because the facilities are luxurious and very lovingly assembled, but the service does not allow to have that 5* service that you would expect. The catering could be much better matched to their prices. People in reception and those responsible, much more resolved, but the service in general, uncoordinated."

The most extremely pleasant: the spa scents from the entrance and in all the corridors. The bathroom with the old-fashioned \"full red marble\" decoration keeps all its charm, it is also really well supplied with cosmetics/hygiene and accessories. Room service is very attentive, fast, discreet. The bedding is a real plus. Very nice. Unfortunately, televisions are not set up in smart mode for modern use... the rest being so positive we go over it. The breakfast self is perfect with excellent waiters by profession. The Tunisian elegance we love. The variety and quality of extra products.  The outdoor pool had just been put back into service, it unfortunately took too many days to heat up for us to enjoy... The spa on the other hand, with the beautiful seawater pool, and absolutely wonderful! The hammam is great, the sauna too. Nice staff. The small fitness room is functional (still lacks enough to clean even the appliances, hygiene is a concern since the staff cannot be behind each passage). The hotel enjoys a lot of outside passage, either by subscription or dinner... this affects the attendance but less than others, and the hotel remains family and well attended. In conclusion: A nice stay."

The indoor pool was the particular side of the residence. the see water comes directly to the pool with a warm temperature and its very comforting. i guess the hotel managers should mention this option more . because we haven't know at the beginning and one of staff told us there. totally the pool area was absolutely welcoming with herbal drinks and several spaces for relaxing. thank you guys. The breakfast was clean fresh by enough kinds of food related the guests taste.  Thanks Ms. Olfa for managing and observing the whole situations there.  the hotel lobby is so spread with historical and beautiful decorations by fully hosting of the staff there.  You can find different kind of restaurants like Chinese and local foods inside the hotel by fine quality.  Rooms are big clean quite with a high-speed WIFI    _ I guess this kind of residence is not suitable for children and gets boring for them and  vice versa is excellent for couples having relax in a luxurious atmosphere of this hotel.    Thank you guys for our peaceful moments there."

        "review_text": "We spent a week in April , then a week in May; we love this place where all the staff are always friendly and smiling; the cuisine is excellent and the rooms are very nice and always clean. The animation team is simply extraordinary and adorable: what dynamism! What joy and kindness! Special mention to Max , our excellent dance and gym teacher , so pedagogue and so funny! Thanks to Bomba and Chocolate; just communication about activities could be easily improved:   the application of Internet activities is useless since it is not up to date; the schedule should be updated daily (near the facilitators' shed): example: you learn only 5 minutes before there is a spinning class (indoor cycling) , the same for the bike ride; you are aware of the Arabic class only by word of mouth, too bad because these activities are interesting. Personally I would also have liked a few short walks in the hinterland and a little more Arabic music. In any case thank you for everything!!!"

This is the first time I insist on posting a review as long as the service of this hotel is horrible. Just about all the staff at this hotel are not trained for the hotel or how to talk with guests (including those in charge). I have never seen a hotel in all exclusive formula where the guest cannot have water in the room. First time in a hotel where after payment you have to go the beach towels in a bazaar shop. Towels throughout the stay will not be washed or replaced. In this hotel we refuse to take the credit card for payment but we force you to withdraw money from their ATM that takes bank fees...."

Although Sousse was not really my kind of place more for beach lovers I think, it was compensated by the wonderful hotel experience.  The staff were very helpful, for example,there was a noisy nightclub facing our room and the staff changed our room immediately.  The food was excellent and caters for everyone. If you are into beach holidays then I would recommend this hotel."

We booked a 3 person room and it was so narrow so we wanted to upgrade it.. they said we dont have any suites and we had to pay an extra room.. yet there wasn’t any information spreading around the staff and when we was in the restaurant for dinner every one had to ask the same question about the room and the dinner.. we explained million times and at the end they bring the check with extra dinner to pay!  The AC was not working and we had to call for one hour till someone came to fix it They had planned an external event on the weekend in the afternoon while people where there to relax in the spa we had to head the crushing of ceramic and screaming of the attendees of the event!  The AC during normal days wasn’t working in the restaurant until this event was held so they opened it when visitors came!  We asked for a cup with ice and the waiter said the soda is already cold why do you need ice!! Everyone was hating themselves during serving dinner!  It was truly a shame .. only those two kind workers .. We definitely will not be back"

Always attentive, caring, she truly embodies the soul of this place. Between oriental dance, walking sticks and her precious advice, she sublimated my stay.  A huge thank you to Noordine for her kindness and attention to breakfast: I felt like a princess every morning, pampered with a big smile. Samia's sfenjs? A real treat, a crisp and gourmet happiness!  Chef Brahim introduced us to the art of sushi with passion and pedagogy — a moment as informative as it is convivial. And what better way to sip a cold drink served by Ali, under the generous sun of Sousse? Finally, a big thank you to Siham, always attentive, who ensured my comfort in the room with great sweetness.  A team with little care, a warm and rejuvenating setting... I leave with a light heart and memories full of head. Thank you for everything ❤️"

I strongly recommend the massages - Houda was great - I chose relaxing massage and for sure it was one of the best in my life.   Another perfect option to entertain yourself is the Fitness and the classes. Nour - the girl who runs them, is positive, very kind and gives you the maximum for every class. I tried the Pilates, Belly dance and the Arabic lessons - all of them were funny, interesting and if I had more time I would try every possible option on daily basis.   The food at the restaurants is great, the rooms are big and clean, the lobby is classy.   I highly recommend this place."

Ignoring the above, the hotel is absolutely incredible.   Some staff shoutouts. Kamal - Pool side, so attentive and always a smile. Made our week.  Habib - Sendai Sushi. An absolute gentleman, nothing was ever too much, his service the year prior made us a repeat customer again this year.  Selmine - Movenpick Restaurant, full of knowledgeable suggestions for places to visit/dine outside the hotel.   During the week we never once had to fight for a sunbed, the pool bar staff were attentive and kept the cocktails flowing.   As part of all inclusive we got a free meal in one of their restaurants. We cannot recommend Sendai Sushi more, it was phenomenal. We went back a second time for Tepinyaka, what a show!   With love from the Isle of Man 🇮🇲 thank you for making our stay."

Perfect. Thanks to him and his team because he really made our days very pleasant. Bravo.  Only downside: it is necessary to know that smoking is allowed in the bar of the Spanish restaurant, so you risk dining in a tobacco smell + a \"responsible\" dined among customers and allowed himself very unpleasant comments about the employees, without any embarrassment or discretion.

        "review_text": "An excellent hotel,we stayed for a week in mid-May and found the room of a good size with a nice view and very well kept by the very friendly housekeeping staff. No complaints there. The hotel itself is clean,the staff are friendly and professional,food was excellent although the buffet restaurant gets very crowded at times. We didn't use the pool as it was too busy/noisy for us but it was well attended and the animation team must be commended for their efforts there. Loungers were good quality and looked comfortable. This is a hotel favoured mainly by French tourists,we were one of very few English/British travellers but we encountered no issues and only a minor language barrier and we had a relaxing week with no issues.  The only thing that would stop us returning (and this hotel is VERY good value for money) is the state of the beach beyond the hotel area. We recovered glass,fragments of roof tiles,building materials,clothing,footwear and endless amounts of plastic. In all of my travels I've never seen so much plastic on a beach. From an environmental point of view it is horrendous, we are not eco-warriors but we care about the sea and the environment surrounding it. This really needs addressing,we've never seen anything like it and over miles of beach it was a similar story all along (this does not at all reflect on the hotel which is well maintained). Otherwise if you like a pool-based holiday in a nice place we would highly recommend here."

Had lots of fun with them. Loved each and every one of them  Rooms small. Food good but often cold and fridges inadequate because you could literally pour the margerine on your rolls. No loaves of bread provided unfortunately which is a shame. Staff great. Loved bar waiter in evenings.  Never waited for a drink. Men's toilets were often flooded and out of order. You definitely need an extension lead as only 2 sockets ( one was for the lamp). Had to ask for kettle twice, then weren't given cups so had to get them from bar. No tea or coffee provided but we took our own. Beach towels ok but small. I bought one from a shop. Overall if these issues were ironed out I'd definitely return because the Animation and staff were absolutely brilliant."

        "review_text": "Got back today after our second time there. Some of the best service from all of the staff we've ever had in a four star. In fact the service just might outweigh some five star hotels we've been to. Everyone's very helpful and friendly and cant do enough for you. Superb cleanliness.   Good quality rooms, if a little dated, but in reality that's not a problem. All you do is sleep there. As I think has been mentioned before there's a lack of wall sockets so take a few adaptors if you have a lot of rechargeable stuff etc. Have to say that the large bowl of fruit and the towels on the bed every day as swans with petals etc was a great touch.  Fantastic animation team (Vicky is a real bonus) and some good acts as well. Bloke on the violin was stand-out! Bar staff are brilliant too. One failure though was one night the act due in the bar was moved to another room leaving those in the bar with out anything. Some music would have been good.  Be aware its quite geared towards French Tour Operators so don't expect lots of British there. Guess what? They don't bite!  If you're a fussy eater like me you might struggle with the food but I can honestly say the quality improving and I found something most nights.  If there's something to change/improve on its the meal arrangements when there's a seminar or a locals event happening. We were there last weekend and the restaurant was complete pandemonium and a free for all. If your a paying tourist and not forceful, and I mean 'forceful', you wont get near anything.  I have to say sadly that I've never seen so many people take so much when clearly needing so little. You don't need four plates of food per person, fruit, ice cream, cake, bread etc between two of you only to leave your table looking like a rubbish tip with uneaten food everywhere for the poor staff to clear up. Might want to give some thought to using another room for those that are not paying tourists.  So my advice is definitely book this hotel as the pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll surely be back this year or next!"

Being an all inclusive holiday the food and drink are crucial to a good holiday and this hotel did not disappoint, the variety and abundance of dishes meant you can find something for all. Traditional, familiar all tasty and beautifully presented.  Although I don’t indulge in alcohol much these days the few I had were very good. Mainly locally brands.  Lifeguards at pools at all times and never a need for towels at dawn to get a sunbed The entertainment team are busy, energetic but not pushy. Many activities to join should you wish Our room was great, large, with a small balcony. By far the best quality were the staff, all levels were cheerful and friendly and very hardworking. A tribute.  Not as polished as maybe Spain, Greece, France, etc. if that’s your bag, Tunisia has had a rough ride for many years, but the best value you’ll find anywhere and the people inside the hotel and out are simply lovely.  A very safe and comfortable feel to the area I highly recommend this hotel"

The breakfast omlettes have to be tried and the omelette chef is great. Pancakes with the chocolate sauce are delicious. There's a brilliant desert selection including ice cream and lots of fresh fruit. The barstaff are great and once they know you they bring your drinks to you. The lobby is huge and great for sitting in. We stayed in a bungalow. But would rather have chosen staying in the hotel itself. Highly recommend this hotel."

All the staff are happy and smiling and are so friendly, nothing is too much trouble.  The lobby is great with a cash machine and welcome drinks.  Check in was fast and stress free, they have currency exchange too as its a closed currency.  You can pay the pool towel deposit in sterling so you don't have to worry about being left with Dinar at the end of your stay.  There is a small shop that has very reasonable prices.  A really massive shout out to the guys at the pool bar and the pool guards and sunbed guys, you made our holiday 'Very Gooood Very Niiice'.  I hope the ducks are living their best lives and I hope the  get to see this.  The pool and surrounding gardens are spotlessly clean.  An absolutely fantastic bunch of guys, so much so that we didn't go to the other pool......   We had a bungalow with garden view (214), our maid was so friendly and always smiling, the beds were made every day and changed whenever we requested, fresh towels every day, the room was spotlessly clean.  Mini fridge was stocked with water and soft drinks and there is shampoo, shower gel, hand soap and body lotion provided and a pretty decent hairdryer.  There are also dressing gowns and slippers provided.  We ate all our meals in the main restaurant we were so happy with the food choices and freshness.  The dishes were not repeated over and over like in some all -inclusives, its was presented fantastically and there was something for everyone.  A huge thank you to Ben the guys up around table 84, you made us feel so welcome and made it feel more than a hotel dining room.  Even though it could be very bust at times they were all smiling and we never had to ask for drinks, they appeared as if by magic!!  The staff here really make the place fantastic.  Thank you for a truly fantastic holiday!!  My partner never likes to go to the same place twice but he has already said he would definitely return here, so you may just see us again very soon (September.....)"

It was large with 2 small doubles pushed together. The shower was really good and it was kept clean.   The grounds in the hotel are clean and tidy. Everyone says hello whilst they work.  The hotel has a well equipped gym. The pools are a good size and there are always plenty of sunbeds available. The pool boys were always there to lay out the lounger cushions for you. The waiters come around asking if you want a drink all day. The beach was also good and we swam in the sea several times.   Food, we were never disappointed with the food. We mainly ate in the buffet restaurant. Our waiter Walhidi was brilliant. He always had our table set and wine ready to pour. He was one of the most friendly people you could meet.   Staff, they were all great, the entertainment team were always friendly and would stop for a chat even if you didn’t take part in the activity.   Bar staff, they were exceptional, they all knew your drinks and would tell you to sit down and they would bring them to you. The attention was great as they would be bringing the next round before you finished.   Tipping was never asked for, unlike Egypt where everyone wants a tip. The staff here were never pushy or rude. Everyone had a smile and seemed genuinely happy. We did tip well overall the two weeks but it was deserved.   Overall a fantastic holiday in Tunisia. This was our first visit here and we never go back to the same place twice however we will make an exception in this case. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making the holiday so good."

The staff remains the big downside. They are not smiling we always have the impression that they mock us. speak poorly French and very poorly organized.

Amazing  choice of food. Something for everyone.  I would like to say how good your Entertainment team are. They are all extremely friendly, informative and helpful. I’ve taken part in a few of the activities and especially like the Aquaswim, Pilates, Yoga and Zumba.  LaLa is a credit to your company. She always goes the extra mile in everything she does. She keeps us all full informed about the activities during the day and in the evening.  In the evenings the entertainment has been great. The team are always attentive and encouraging.  Thank you. Keep up the good work.  I would definitely recommend this hotel."

During our stay every day was made to feel like a dream, the staff there are out of this world always had a smile and so friendly, I give a big thank you to Adel from the restaurant made our every meal time unreal, Hazem from the pool never without a drink top waiter. Sahbi from the snack bar true ace, Nidhal the lifeguard was there to always have a great laugh and managed to get my wife to go down the water slide she hates her head going under water tops marks and a big thanks to all the animation team Alex, Bibo, Willy, Salah, and Malek these guys put there heart and soul in to the entertainment ever day and night top guys.  So a big thanks to the hotel and all its staff that make this place a dream come true already booked to go back next year, thanks for the best 10 days ever"

Big shout out to Adel from the restaurant, Sahbi from the snack bar, Hazem from the pool bar, Nidhal the lifeguard and from the animation team Alex, Bido, William and new boy Malek. Fabulous 10 days and will be returning again very soon, thanks and love to you all."

Swimming pool and beach beds at the top to enjoy the sun...in short a beautiful experience, to be repeated soon for 10 days this time rather than 7..That's all. ..

What is particularly positive to mention is the childcare, the animator \"Lolli\" is a real asset to the hotel, she is not only friendly, competent and reliable, the children love her and we loved the way she treats the children.  Lolli is just great!  We can absolutely recommend the hotel for families with children 👍👍 We are already looking forward to our next holiday there and our children are looking forward to Lolli🤗"

Food is versatile and excellent. for such a large mass of cooking this is not often encountered. Only it was disappointing for us, maybe the wrong time. The UK crowd was rowdy in the restaurant and lobby. Children could express themselves where I don't write an opinion now. The plates at lunch and dinner were overloaded with what then disappeared into the trash. It is a pity that this partly disadvantaged the holiday atmosphere.  Visited this hotel four times for the purpose! Back home, but this time it was not the case. It's too bad."

        "review_text": "We booked the hotel for the fourth time. First in advance maybe it was a wrong time from May 6 to 16. Never experienced such a noisy time in this hotel as in this period. It was crowded, In the restaurant it was a clatter of plates, sliding chairs and screams of jewelery. Our compliments to the staff who provided polite and optimal service. The food is excellent and versatile. This was also evident in many people from the lavishly filled plates which were later thrown away. (Definitely nothing used to at home). After 8pm it really started. Instead of enjoying a cup of coffee with a drink in the beautiful lobby, the screaming started with excessive children's disco violence. For dessert, the loud house pounding alternated with Miss hotel pageant or Drag Queen until 23:00. Past times it has been held outside or in another location of the hotel. Fine for the lovers but not for us. JAZ Tour Khalef a pearl of Sousse but this time the glass was far from there. About the hotel nothing to criticize service, friendliness no trouble too much this is really TOP. Rooms are neat, park and pool with stand is neat and everything with a top service. Too bad a beautiful location with all possibilities both the city of Sousse and surroundings as stand. But not for us anymore."

But my biggest disappointment was the beach area. The pool adults only, was not clearly indicated, so there were kids and the lifeguard doesn’t say anything. The good  seats were blocked  early morning, and the lifeguard did not do anything against it, as he was also blocking for some people. Obviously not enough room for the many people in the hotel."

        "review_text": "Just back from a week long stay, here is my honest review.  From landing at Enfidha Airport we were around 3 hours to the hotel which was a long journey but we knew when we booked it that this would be the case which is a shame as Monastir Airport is relatively closer but there were no flights to there from Scotland.  We were greeted by the staff who took our bags up to our room for us, the rooms were lovely and we had a sea view which was outstanding. The maids changed our towels and beds everyday but went the extra mile with the lovely towel art. Can’t fault the rooms.  The pool was lovely and spacious and the service round the pool was amazing, before we had finished our drinks the bar staff would come over with fresh drinks all day long, possibly some of the best service I’ve ever had. The animation team done a great job keeping everyone entertained and a special mention to the water polo which was very competitive but lots of fun.  The food at lunch and dinner was nice, not exceptional but really good and lots on offer if you are a fussy eater.   The night time entertainment was a laugh and the animation team done a good job at the comedy nights by the getting the crowd up and involved. Once again as soon as You finished a drink they were over asking if you wanted more drinks.  Only a couple of negatives to take away from our trip:  The breakfast, it wasn’t to our taste which does not mean it is bad but it’s a lot more continental which included pastries, fresh fruit and vegetables. We lived on omelets and scrambled eggs all week😂.   The cocktails were sometimes non drinkable and tasted nothing like what they should have been. These are vodka and then they are put into a machine and the machine adds the mixers. We ordered strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas, these tasted nothing like what they should have but again this may be because they are poured out of a machine.  And last of all was the horse and carriage outside the hotel, I love animals and was saddened to see the horse stand outside in the heat with no constant water supply, I actually did not see the horse receive water once and I would regularly check. I just hope the horses are looked after.  These are the only downfalls to take away.   Apart from these it was a magnificent stay and I would 100% return as the service was excellent."

The entertainments team work hard at keeping everyone happy without being too pushy.  The restaurant and food were outstanding and you can also go to the Tunisian A’ la Carte which we absolutely loved.  The all inclusive drinks package covers enough different drinks to keep most folks happy, the bar staff turn to a couple of times a week and have cocktails poolside and in foyer.  The rooms are a decent size and the cleaning staff work hard to keep everything extremely clean and tidy.  They were replacing all the carpets on all floors while we were there it was not intrusive and they worked hard to cause minimal disruption."

        "review_text": "- [ ] There was no iron in the room so we had to ask for it. And we had it for the duration of our trip.  - [ ] No water unless all inclusive despite being 4 starts.  - [ ] Food alright same all the time. They did have chips and nuggets at one point which did save me.  - [ ] Decent location with shops and bazar close by. Also 20 min walk and you’re near the Maxi center where there are more food places and shops.  - [ ] We experienced our first carnival  - [ ] Booked excursion and tourist stuff through hotel as it was more reliable.  - [ ] The hotels spa rooms were being refurbed so we were able to go to another hotel and use their facilities. There is a guy there who works at iberostar and takes people to the spa place (2 min drive)  - [ ] Customer service went above and beyond 10/10. We booked 2 sea view rooms which we did and had a door connecting the rooms. We weren’t happy with the bathroom or the bedding. They kindly moved us to the opposite room for the night and said they’ll sort it in the morning. They kindly gave us water when we spoke to them about the room and there not being any water. In the morning they said they’re doing everything they can, made sure whatever room we got it had a sea view and they made sure of it. They let us check out the rooms before they moved us to make sure we were happy and we were. Again the bathroom wasn’t the greatest but it was bearable - [ ] For a 4 star hotel I expected more. Interior a little outdated.  - [ ] Wish the pool hours were a little longer so after a long day of being out we could’ve spent time in the pool. Maybe because of the season it’s 9am-6pm.  - [ ] No air con doesn’t come on until June…let’s just say sometimes it did get a little warm but nothing too bad.  -[ ] 24/7 security outside the hotel and its gates and they do security checks on each and every vehicle.  - [ ] Overall the stay, hospitality and people there were amazing."

        "review_text": "Traveled as friends we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights as a little getaway and it was brilliant. The service from staff at this hotel was amazing the hotel itself is lovely there’s a big pool with a swim up bar which the drinks were good, very good from the barman Mtir. The food in the dining hall was nice I would say it’s abit repetitive but there was every meat you could want and more, the food stations don’t always have signs on to tell you what dish it is maybe that could be improved but still delicious as was dessert and fruit options. The entertainment team were fantastic always making sure you’re happy around the pool asking you to get involved with activities and teaching you dances etc. Big shout out to Yuma & Alpha they were brilliant. Evening entertainment was okay could’ve been abit more on and didn’t finish too early. The rooms are spacious with 2 wardrobes comes with a fridge and separate toilet to the bathroom, beds were comfy however pillows were abit hard.. the corridors to the rooms were a abit outdated and could do with a little touch up but nothing big. Our time at this hotel was lovely and I would recommend it if you’re looking for a quiet place to stay! Right on a sandy beach. Thanks to all the lovely staff / entertainment staff."

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Iberostar Waves Averroes from May 8 to 12 with my mother, aunt and cousin to celebrate my mom’s birthday. This trip had great sentimental value for us, as we came to discover our grandmother’s homeland. And this hotel has made our stay even more special.  Upon arrival, we were greeted with warmth and kindness. The staff was simply adorable, always attentive, attentive and available at all times. So much so that they have come to call us “the family”, which perfectly sums up the friendly and caring atmosphere that prevails in the hotel.  The setting is idyllic: a large swimming pool, beautiful gardens perfectly maintained, a private beach with direct access... A real little corner of paradise. The cleaning team also touched us with its delicate attention: folded towels in adorable shapes, small flowers on the bed... simple gestures that were always pleasure 🌸  The most beautiful memory is undoubtedly our meeting with the animation team. Thanks from the bottom of my heart to Faty, Djappa, Alpha and the whole team for their good humor, humor and communicative energy. Thanks to them, we participated in lots of activities, laughed and created memories engraved forever. You can see that they really love what they do, and it’s a real joy to see them convey so much joy.  The icing on the cake, we also met great people during our stay, with whom we immediately sympathized. Many shared laughs, simple but sincere moments that made our experience even more beautiful.  As for the restaurant, the buffet was well supplied and varied: international dishes, fresh fruit at will, and a small stand of local specialities. A big thank you to the catering team, always available and attentive. The only downside would be the lack of typical Tunisian dishes throughout the buffet, and a little disappointment regarding the restaurant “L’Olivier”.  But overall, Miss France leaves with stars full of eyes 👑✨ A huge thank you to the entire Iberostar Waves Averroes team for these precious moments. We leave with a light heart, a calm mind and with memories full of head 💛"

The hotel was well maintained and clean throughout, with security on the gate making it feel a safe place to relax.   The reception staff were welcoming and helpful answering any questions we had regarding taxi prices and destination advice.  The entertainment team were really friendly, encouraging everyone to participate in the activities.  We played petanque on the beach, darts around the pool and Yoga every morning. Bingo, Tunisia night and cocktail evenings where just a few of the evening entertainment activities.   The Laurier buffet restaurant was spacious and offered a wide selection of foods. We also used the La Palmier the beach buffet area most lunch times. Waiters at both were very welcoming, attentive and polite.  Abdul was our main waiter in the Fleurs Dr Lys lounge bar. He was great, surprising us with delicious cocktails every evening.  Amhed was our main pool bar waiter, again fabulous service remembering our drinks orders and ensuring we had plenty of bottled water for our room.    Our housekeeper, unfortunately we didn't catch her name, was great. Always making sure we had clean towels etc and surprising us with fabulous towel origami each day.   Tunisia it's self is a beautiful place with white sandy beaches and a clear blue sea. However, it is a very poor part of the world and you can see this in the upkeep of some of the buildings and empty hotels"

        "review_text": "We stayed a week in all inclusive at this hotel in early April. The hotel is well located, with direct access to the beach, and not far from the Medina. Nothing to say about the reception and service, all the staff, whether at the reception, restaurant or activities, is helpful and inviting. It wasn't the full season yet so the hotel was quiet, I guess there must be more people later in the season. On the other hand, the pool bar was not open yet, and the entertainment a little light, no or few people attended, so it was always a bit the same every night despite the efforts of the whole animation team who were passing really nice and with whom we had very good times. At the restaurant level, the buffet for all meals is complete, varied and really good, we ate very (too) well all week. The drinks offered as part of the package are enough, we did not have to add to get what we wanted. The rooms are rather spacious for 2, maybe a little more just for 3 (we were 5 and we had 2 connecting rooms of identical size, one for 2 and one for 3), on the other hand the shower was large and well designed, it is rare to be able to take a shower in a hotel without having to water the whole bathroom. A small downside, however, on the maintenance, we could see that several elements were patched together, such as the toilet-paper support, like the somewhat capricious flush, or like the bathroom door that did not close because she had worked. We had a great week and would recommend this hotel."

At lunch as at dinner there was a lot of variety but it was really guessing that you ate because there were either no signs or they were not in their correct order. Then if you want to eat something between lunch and dinner, basically make do with what's left of lunch. Regarding the cleanliness leaves enough to be desired, at one time we arrived in the afternoon and had not yet cleaned the room. The hotel lacks much maintenance and better ventilation especially on the first floor where the restaurant windows are... Oh, and the heated pool is just the mbiebte, not the water.  Read more"

We have nothing to complain about, we were so well looked after by the staff across all areas of the hotel. From the maid in our room to the waiters in the restaurant, pool and main bar and the animation team. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all so friendly and great with the grandchildren.  It’s a larger hotel than we are used to but there was always sunbeds round the pool and  beach and somewhere to sit in the evening. As we were a party of nine a table was saved for us in the dining room by our lovely waiter Khaled everyday.  Food was lovely, great selection every night, so plenty to choose from and something for everybody. First visit to this hotel but 8th to Tunisia, we will return again"

As mentioned the room’s need some refurb, cracked tiles etc, but that can be a good overlooked as the cleaning staff keep the rooms very clean and tidy, “Sonia” was our cleaner and greeted us with her wonderful smile daily and the service from her and her team was 5 stars.

We have nothing to complain about, we were so well looked after by the staff across all areas of the hotel. From the maid in our room to the waiters in the restaurant, pool and main bar and the animation team. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all so friendly and great with the grandchildren.  It’s a larger hotel than we are used to but there was always sunbeds round the pool and  beach and somewhere to sit in the evening. As we were a party of nine a table was saved for us in the dining room by our lovely waiter Khaled everyday.  Food was lovely, great selection every night, so plenty to choose from and something for everybody. First visit to this hotel but 8th to Tunisia, we will return again"

Their welcoming was not that great, as no one came to us to show the hotel and introduce us every thing, we had to find and look for all the facilities. Other than that the room was very clean, the lady Farida was very nice and hardworking. She is very helpful and friendly.  Food was very good and organised. Waiters were friendly and polite. Sea water pool was amazing but not enough sit for everyone.  All the staff in the hotel were very nice and friendly. I will recommend this hotel for relaxing coz it bit far from the madina or souk."

That aside we thoroughly enjoy our stay and there’s a lot on offer for families, this is our 2nd stay and we would come back again.  All staff are amazing, it’s a shame we can’t name everyone individually, but special shout to animation team : Yaya and Maya for the kids club / activities and Mira,Lou Lou, Speedy, Cristiano and not forgetting the DJ Steve all deserve 5 stars they make the stay fun and you can’t help but attached to them, it’s sad to say bye but we’ll be back.  As mentioned the room’s need some refurb, cracked tiles etc, but that can be a good overlooked as the cleaning staff keep the rooms very clean and tidy, “Sonia” was our cleaner and greeted us with her wonderful smile daily and the service from her and her team was 5 stars.  Thanks to all the staff bar staff and waiters can’t name you all we felt truly well looked after.  Tesh, Hena & Ethan"

He didn’t lie, we saw the dolphins 🐬🩵 Small negative for some waiters especially at the central bar which are not all pleasant. We didn’t like the buffet of the restaurant either... the meals are good unfortunately the buffet was never full enough and / or too repetitive. The Tunisian restaurant upstairs is really to avoid, I’m sorry but it was really not good!  Value for money but be careful it is not a real all inclusive for me: some drinks are extra (mojito, pressed orange juice, perpermint...) the gym is also paid, safe deposit box..."

The waiters hide to not set you a table .... They serve you in a dirty glass seen with my eyes recovering at the storage table behind us... When there is the welcome cocktail do not expect to have a drink at the bar there are more.... When you have two bedrooms and in both the towels are missing to shower and you manage to have other ones but the moor when the maid makes the room she does not replace her .... No outdoor bar and overall cleanliness very very limited from any point of view. No bar at the beach it is dismantled throughout our stay nor deckchair. When all the staff in general are not friendly and I find a waiter from an old hotel I stayed at the previous year who tells me that he quits because the atmosphere is very bad. Even after worldwide claim tourism does not believe its guests but believe the hotel this is the last time I leave with them no consideration and hotel has fled apsokuously to spend a good family holiday."

        "review_text": "We've recently arrived home from Bel Azur (A group of 4). From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we fully enjoyed our stay here. The hotel was clean, the pool was very inviting. There were a good selection of food to choose from at meal times, as well as pool side snacks during the day. And drinks were very well measured if you like to get tipsy - very easily.  But I'm a lightweight.  All staff couldn't do enough for you. Always greeting you with a smile. You could walk alone within the grounds and beach feeling safe without any worry.   Personally the Animation Team made my holiday. There were plenty going on during the day to join in with. They made their way around the pool to say good morning  to all guests which set your day up feeling happy. A  good personal touch! In the evenings their shows were performed to a high standard, very energetic and fun to watch.  Plenty of dancing too!  I have to say a massive thanks to Roger for all of his hard work. Always putting in 100% and with the running of his team.  A true professional!"

The entertainment team were amazing and attentive and put on a variety if activities suited for everyone and the shows in the evening. There was always something going on! Special shout out to Simon, who interacted well with everyone and made all the activities even more fun! Very attentive and made was such a positive and friendly person who made us feel very welcome and safe even when going outside the hotel! Don’t think I saw him without a smile on his face!

We are really looking forward to seeing Simon and his team again, as we have known him from another hotel for almost two years! We are so happy to have met him and feel welcome and supported and would travel anywhere he goes. He has such a friendly, unobtrusive and very helpful manner...my daughter is always very happy about the animation team's t-shirts :)!  All day long you can take part in activities such as Zumba and yoga and dance classes...or table tennis and darts...also volleyball in the summer. But if you just want to watch or relax, you won't be pressured, but it will be accepted and you can watch or just enjoy the peace and quiet.  The special highlight is always the evening shows, in which the team can show off their skills! The management is also very accommodating and helpful. For example, I contacted the hotel in advance to get a specific bungalow with a sea view and was very pleased that it went smoothly. If there were any problems, everyone was very helpful. You just feel very welcome.  I would immediately recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to spend a nice, relaxing holiday, in a very beautiful spot, with a wonderful sea view and with great, friendly staff!❤️"

The food is a bit hit and miss but we generally found something to eat. The waiting staff were amazing and kept us a table every night and our glasses topped up!  The animation team are the best I’ve ever come across. The evening entertainment shows are brilliant and wonderfully choreographed.  The guys work so hard and are so friendly but not pushy if you don’t want to join in, they don’t push you to. Special mention to Simon who was so friendly and always stopped to have a chat an a laugh with us. He was always happy to help with any problems, generally a great guy!   Definitely recommend this hotel and we would return  ❤️"

We went back later to be told you have choice of 2 rooms 1st no balcony so 2nd was over looking pool and sea. Room was dated but clean.   Food was ok found something every day. I didn't like the papper cups at breakfast for juices. Lunch and evening meal you had bottle water. For myself not enough serving spoons food was getting picked up by closest server spoon tongs. Bread is hard for toast. Also labeling is not correct says chicken and ws cheese 1 day. Choice between red white wine beer or pop. Plenty salad soups wasnt to my liking bit bland.  Drinks vodka i liked no issues hubby liked beer, they did diet drinks as well as full sugar.   Entertainment was good day and night they didn't pester you if you said no. The animation team are good ..   1 massive thing was they allowed a very ignorent man in hotel always drunk and was swearing and threatening people. I reported him to head manager after a issue.  I was not only person to complain but was over looked and they still gave him beer when he was threatening people and bad language. I was looking over my shoulders all time.   Reception staff need to be addredsing ressed rude and don't speak or understand lot of English.   I personally will never return to this hotel."

        "review_text": "I booked this hotel based on the numerous positive reviews, but was disappointed in almost every aspect. The service leaves much to be desired. While the staff appears to make an effort, there is a lack of genuine attentiveness and professionalism. Waiting times for service are often long, and inquiries are sometimes ignored or answered reluctantly. The service staff is  friendly.  The food is mediocre at best. The selection is limited, many dishes are bland, and the overall quality feels like mass-produced catering. The atmosphere in the dining area was particularly disturbing: during meals, there was often a lot of noise and unrest. Muslim children ran around the buffet area unsupervised, throwing food on the floor and playing loudly. Unfortunately, the staff did nothing to address the situation, even though it was clearly unpleasant for many guests.  We booked an upgrade for the Starprestigue Room and additional space in the hotel and outside. But even with the upgrade (€€) we felt like a normal guest or even less seen than others. Sure we understand that tips are very common and seen and we also give more when the service ist good at the start (first looking how good the service is). It was not really relaxing sadly. We were like transparent. You don't give since day one something youre out. Sadly. But even with an upgrade - which costs extra - you have no \"extra\" Extra.  In addition, the hotel is in urgent need of renovation. Many areas feel outdated and do not match the standard advertised.  Anyone seeking peace, relaxation, and a premium vacation experience will likely be disappointed. I cannot recommend this hotel and will advise my travel agency to stop recommending it as well."

I want to give special credit to the Rawdha room cleaner, who gave us amazing service with a smile. My check-in reception  staff, Salava and Marvin, was very professional and polite. Snack bar near the swimming pool Nadia and her manager were excellent.  Nada worked very hard and constantly provided good service and her men  manager who look after us ist day with issue staff placing used serving spoon after eating  from dish which was on display for guest. That was unacceptable; I think this member of staff may have been given a break to eat and decided to help himself. I am sorry for mentioning that as it does matter to all the guests.  At restaurant  waiter I took picture with was excellent  above and beyond of any expectation. I forgot name sorry. Special mention to Abdul , the one always with smile and helpful. My ring donut lady made special effort to make yummy ring donut for me. Tall men at omlate station went extra mile to give good service.   In short most of staff is gems to  hotel. Just want to let everybody to be aware they serve only local alcoholic drinks if one is fussy they bring their own. Waiter who served us drinks yesterday need special mention for his service.  Well done Ibrostar, we will be back."

We did have dinner in Tunisian al a carte but this wasn’t as good as the food on the buffet restaurant.   The terrace waiters constantly brought us drinks.   The bedding and rooms cleaned to a very high standard.   We will definitely be back. Thank you for a lovely time"

Not on par with other 5* hotels and Iberostar could do with injecting some money to bring it up to the standard of its sister hotel the Kuriat Palace however some of the staff exceed 5*. Najua our housekeeper kept our room very clean with beautiful bed art. Kamel in the star prestige area deserves a shoutout along with Raouf (bartender), MedAli (waiter), Marwen (front desk), Ayman (bar tender in lobby) and Lassad (bar manager), these people have made our holiday and have shown consistency in there service to ensure us a fabulous stay. Thank you, we will be back."

        "review_text": "Trip advisor  This was our annual girl’s trip away. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by Houseem who took care of us during the whole trip. We upgraded to a star prestige room which was lovely. The room had a super king bed, coffee machine, mini bar and had been beautifully cleaned and prepared by Rahma. A Star Prestige room gave you free sun-bed towels, 25% off the spa, private sunbathing area and access to a roof top sunbathing terrace, this also had a hot tub and there were a selection of pastries and sandwiches to help yourself to. Mohamad was on bar duty on the rooftop and looked after all the guests amazingly.   In the buffet restaurant we were looked after by zadine who found us a table each afternoon and evening. The food was great with a variety of different cuisines to choose from. There is also a restaurant which serves Italian or Tunisian menus on different nights, this can get busy so best to book on arrival.  There were a couple of organised trips you could go on- to the Madina, on a catamaran or quad biking. We went on the catamaran. We pre booked the spa in advance as last year it was fully booked and had 2 treatments during our stay and made full use of the gym and swimming pool.  Each evening a different cocktail was served in the bar and entertainment was put on.  A huge shout out to our waiters Aymen and Oussama, they were great and looked after us during our stay  A huge thank you to the staff. This was the second year we have stayed here and  yet again we had an amazing time. We have already started looking for our visit for next year. See you all in 2026 xx"

Second, Yassine by the pool looked after us and kept bringing us drinks without even asking. Next was Abdelaziz and Hitchem in the restaurant who were lovely and so friendly. Next we want to mention the food, the chefs really cooked outstanding food, we were amazed how the lamb, beef and chicken were cooked perfectly especially when it was batched cooked! (There are plenty of veg options such as salad bar, vegan corner etc) The food that stood out was the Tunisian food and sweets. The all inclusive drinks had a very large choice including alcoholic and non alcoholic to cater everyone. Entertainment were very hard working and didnt badger you if you didnt want to join. One small criticism is we hoped for more Tunisian inspired shows etc and less of cruise ship inspired acts. Overall, a wonderful holiday we did not want to end and we will definitely be back to Tunisia in the future. À bien tôt!"

        "review_text": "What can I say AMAZING . Just returned from a week’s holiday here and what an amazing experience we had. The hotel is clean and tidy. The rooms are basic but you don’t spend much time in them so it’s ok. The food was lovely, something for everyone. I do advise you to bring your own cups as they serve you soft drinks in tiny paper cups. The waiting staff are absolutely amazing. So attentive and kind. Giving them a small tip for their service made them treat us like VIP’s. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Treat with respect to be treated with respect. As for the animation team, FANTASTIC. They are so welcoming and super friendly. They go all out for the guests, chatting and getting you to get involved. They are amazing with children, doing kids dances every evening letting them be on the stage dancing while they stand on the dance floor doing the actions making the children the stars of the show, Joe, Eddi, Rio, Leo just to name a few, ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.  There was a man called Amid who sold trips on a pirate ship, camel treck, quads etc, who was really lovely. The pirate ship was the highlight of my holiday. Thanks Amid x Overall the holiday was FANTASTIC. I am ready looking to book again. Thank you guys for the perfect holiday xx🇹🇳"

To be told that it was fine and then when I got there 1 day into my trip I had a security man who was a piece of work himself turn up at my room door to take my drone off me. He then got the police involved even though he lied and said he didn’t. The guest relations manager Abir told us it was him and he’s a horrible human. I ended up having my drone seized and Abir has since ignored all my messages as I needed police details for my insurance claim. As for the hotel, the food was average and the rooms was dirty!"

The new animation teal they bought in after sacking the old ones are so bad they don't interact with guests or put on shows all they do is let the guests participate every night karaoke/female beauty pageant/men v women that's all they do. Maybe the male members of team should spend less time bedding the female guests which  I saw.  Now the reception staff the worse I've ever come across in my life the women especially yesterday telling me to go take shower at pool as I had vacated room at 12 and didn't fly till v late I was very upset to b spoken to like that at 65 absolutely no respect for women. Eventiyhe asst manager came to help resolve problem. The best thing bout this hotel is the food in restaurant the best choice I've ever had.will I be returning here NEVER and not will any of the other English guests I spoke to but I suppose the hotel not bothered by ENGLISH not returning"

The only issue at the beginning was that the room was warm, but they said the a/c wasn't turned on until June 1st. After I got a small fan, the room was very comfortable! The biggest plus at the Riadh Palms for me was the staff there. They were so welcoming and friendly! Fadhel who worked at reception and handled currency exchange was super nice and helpful for me, especially when I couldn't get the TV remote to work. Also, Isra, who worked as a hostess at the hotel restaurant couldn't have been more kind!! During my 6 day stay there I mostly had Ali, Anwar, and Anas as my waiters at the hotel restaurant and all 3 were so kind and entertaining and attentive to any needs I had. Great job! Lastly, Ola and Odel, who both worked in the reception area were very kind, and Ola helped me set up an excursion to the city of Kairaoun. I highly recommend this hotel!"

And then the horror starts, we lived in room 4105, apparently a mouse or other animal died in the vent, if you turn on the air conditioner for a long time, then on your return the corpse smell, okay, you can keep the air conditioner on, then ok. Beds, furniture, pillows, curtains and everything else is clean, but very, very old, everything is stuccoed, and already just throw away, impossible to use.  It concerns everything, elevator, sunbeds on the beach, towels there, umbrellas , ace just need to throw away!!! By the way no one ever cleans the beach, okay the sand was leveled, the algae garbage has not been removed, but the whole beach is complete!!!! In the faeces of camels and horses (they ride tourists on the beach) no one!!! It doesn't.  The staff just don't want anything, nobody's even trying to do anything.  Spa separate story for 80 € is the worst massage imaginable!!! And the spa itself is dirty and long in need of repair. So it's not a 5* or a 4* that's probably a 3*--' breakfast by the way also leaves a lot to be desired.  You should avoid this place!!!"

        "review_text": "Our stay at this hotel was unfortunately a consistently disappointing experience. The hygienic conditions were unacceptable: So we were served drinks bottles that had bird droppings on them, and the tiles in the room were also damaged. The indoor pool was heavily polluted and looked very run-down overall. Also the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired, as fresh towels were often only provided after multiple requests.  The culinary offer also did not meet our expectations. The food was low quality and the choice in the all-inclusive offer very limited. We also had to pay additional fees for almost all other services, even though we had booked all-inclusive. There were only two ways to get free drinks, which were also only open at certain times.  The experience at the à la carte restaurant was particularly disappointing. We were assured a voucher for dinner after a conversation with the hotel management, but this was not accepted during our visit. Instead, we only received a limited menu, as is also offered to regular all-inclusive guests. Our demand was ignored and we felt mistreated overall.  Also at the reception we received no support in solving our problems. Finally, we had to go to the buffet restaurant with our children, where they suddenly paid conspicuous attention to our table after our situation had probably become known.  Another problem was the defective elevator, which made it very difficult to use the hotel with a stroller on the third floor.  Overall, this stay was a great disappointment. Our expectations for a relaxing holiday have been far exceeded, and we have felt greatly frustrated by the repeated shortcomings and poor service. We can not recommend this hotel."

Congratulations to Assia, Ayda and Essia. The service at the bar (Lahzar in the morning and Houcine in the evening) is excellent. The buffet is varied and changes daily. The rooms are nice and large. Points of improvement should be noted: wine list to review. Wine ageing and not up to standard. The Tunisian restaurant Flamingo is a disappointment. The service was slow and disorganized. Cleaning in the rooms is done quickly. No vacuum cleaners, so carpets aren't made... The spa and treatments are very nice.  Note that we were able to take 2 beautiful horseback rides with Mohsen (independent) on the beach in front of the hotel. He is trusted and his horses are well fed and treated.  The pool is huge and the staff is helpful, offering towels, deckchairs and cushions at will.  Evening entertainment (concert) is not exceptional."

We arrive very late in the evening because delay of the flight, my friend being ill she must eat. They're bringing us two plates so far, everything goes, carrot salad cucumbers a miserable slice of je ne sais quoi, no shabby brief seasoning. The next day we look for ourselves or go to lunch because the friendliness of the people at the reception does not make you want to ask anything....  Now let's talk about the wifi...no wifi accessible in the room..the wifi is only at the reception and around the pool still you have to choose the right place...then the high speed wifi announcement is only a lie.  Now let's talk about the bedroom , the wardrobe smells musty, the bedroom smells old, an unpleasant smell.  Cleaning is not the passion of this hotel, disgusting windows not only in the room but everywhere in the commons.  On the balcony two miserable dirty chairs, a rotten table cracked a rotten mini dryer where you can put nothing on it .....  The room with both beds this remains just a pretty clean place.  The toilet and the bathroom I don't talk about it...u. dry hair that must date because crack and it can burn hands.  Cockroach meets in the toilet.....  Now let's talk about the indoor bar... unpleasant waiters no sympathy.  Pool not heated but clean finally a positive.  The buffet was at least good and varied as well as lunch there I can say nothing again.  Atmosphere had to look for her in the hotel next door....just one nice evening in the hotel with a singer.  Hotel is old.  The view from the room on a huge open waste site brief ...."

Sewage smell every time you walk to the beach  Little to non security people coming of the streets stealing drinks and other personal items  Cleaners don’t know how to knock even then will still walk in whilst having a shower Drinks are just not nice. Just the cheapest you can find For the first couple days you will be like a lost dog. Don’t even try and read the map as it’s just very outdated as well as everything else"

There was a great choice of food, well cooked & the dining area was clean & all waiting staff very friendly & efficient. Some bedrooms were probably a bit dated but the hotel is doing refurbishments & ours was clean. The animation team were marvellous, we go on a few hols a year & these guys are one of the best we've seen in awhile, their energy is great. Probably one downside they could do with a few more public toilets around the complex."

The Aquagym course is top. We're laughing really good. In the evening the entertainment is very good too, no time to be bored. The only demolishment is that in early June the aquapark is still closed (check the opening of the park). The food is not bad but maybe a little effort can be made at this level. Basically recommend this hotel. The housekeepers are also very adorable. Top top top, we'll probably come back as a family again."

A huge thank you especially to Habib Hamouda for his welcome, human warmth, availability and kindness ❤️. He was more than just a staff member: he witnessed our happiness to my partner and I. ✨💍A memory forever etched in our hearts... Thank you, Habib, for sharing this emotion with us.  Small downside though on the cleaning in the room, which would have deserved a little more attention.  And for a 4-star, it would be really nice to find a small bottle of fresh water when we arrive in the room — a simple little gesture, but one that makes all the difference... Despite these details, it did not spoil the beauty of our stay.  I highly recommend this place, and hope to return very soon! ☀️"

Bar staff try to keep you happy and keep on top of your drinks, even when your lazing by the sea!  Darts at 11:30, such great fun with Mo & Omar! Archery at 16:00 with Zezu and Omar, never played it before and really enjoyed it! I had my nails done in the spa which was a nice great, manicure and pedicure. A friend said she'd enjoyed a full body 2hr massage adhd it was the best she'd ever had! The weather was variable when we were there but the spa pool is lovely and warm so a bit of cloud on a cooler day means you can still enjoy the water. Entertainment, food, drinks, gorgeous setting, we couldn't have asked for more! One l'il tip. There are coffee making facilities but only powdered milk, which changes the taste but it still looks like you're drinking black coffee. You can get cartons of milk from the shop up the road, a short walk away.   Thank you for having us!   P.S please leave the swift nests up, I was really sad to see one had been knocked down while we were there, but the clever birds rebuilt it!"

Breakfast dinner and tea was the same every single night! Not even a chicken nugget or fish fingers for the kids! Cereal was stale every morning too! Staff stand and stare at you while eating, some standing right behind you while your eating! Made me feel really uncomfortable. Ordered panini at snack bar French lady came and ordered after me soo the worker stopped making my panini and served the French lady first! Overall food, drinks and snack bar is disgusting I was going to the shop over the road for some super noodles that’s how poor the food is! Cocktails are vile too.  ENTERTAINMENT  very poor nothing on same shows repeated every few days had football on for 3 nights in a row and stopped all the kids party dances for these nights.  ROOM cleaners were lovely and room was cleaned everyday however the passage and our room stunk of sewage! You only get 1 key card so can’t leave nothing charging while your out! Beds very uncomfortable our shower was also broke no drinks in the fridge which I was surprised at giving it’s a 4 star hotel!  Staff hang around you waiting for tips constantly!  Only positive I have is muna and the 2 young girls at kids club they went out their way to play with my daughter at the park and on an evening. They are the only staff that have manners and respect for their guests unlike the others! So big Thankyou to the 3 girls  We left the resort once and we were told put your phone away otherwise you will be robbed I’ve never felt more unsafe on a holiday in my life was counting down the days to go home Overall I would not return didn’t feel safe or welcome here. This hotel is not a 4 star more a 2/3!"

    "description": "La Badira, member of the Leading Hotels of the World, recounts Hammamet's illustrious past, since Paul Klee's trip to Tunisia in 1914, followed by dozens of artists, such as André Gide, Arletty, Oscar Wilde, Jean Cocteau and Sophia Loren. All came to Hammamet in search of the rare quality of its light. La Badira has 130 suites of 45m² to 160m2, five restaurants combining tradition and innovation, and the only Spa by CLARINS in the country. Intimate spaces have been created in and around the hotel with a library, an indoor fireplace, La Badira cocktail bar, and jasmine and bitter orange scented lawns. The shop, dedicated to local craftsmanship, illustrates the authenticity and charm of Tunisia. Like travelers, writers and adventurers of the last century, guests feel at home and with friends. La Badira represents all the charm of yesteryear revisited with a modern approach, a place where regular visitors and newcomers can mingle with simplicity, elegance and discretion.Read more",

At the tour operators, I would advise to make THE distinction between La Badira 5 stars (exceptional hotel) and other 5 stars hotels (no reviews). In short a stay in the area,as far as I am concerned, is automatically synonymous with a reservation in La Badira. Thank you again!!!!!!!!! Alain"

I just had 2 ceaser salads delivered to the room ($60 or so US) that I’ve had to send back and now I’m going to bed hungry. Ordered a steak yesterday, paid the $40 and left it on the plate. Going on a five star holiday is senseless if the food is inedible.   The internet has not been working. I’ve missed 3 days of work. They brought a new router today but it’s too late.   The staff is lovely but it doesn’t matter if you go on a holiday and, despite being willing and happy to pay whatever price, you can’t get anything edible and you can’t complete obligatory tasks. I wish I could go home early. We’ve had maybe 9 dishes so far and not one has been actually good. Burgers are tying us over, but my god why would I go on a holiday to stay barely satiated to get by. I’m not a picky eater with this in mind, it’s just not good.   I’m ready to leave."

        "review_text": "Quick summary.  Not so good bits - Rooms dated. Beds were firm (I struggled to sleep). Restaurant temporarily runs out of plates mid service (little frustrating).  Good bits - Pool areas and private beach area fantastic. I found the range of food really good during lunch and evening (however breakfast was really limited for anyone with an english breakfast expectation). All the staff seemed friendly and decent. The entertainment crew were also fantastic and really do make a difference around the pool during the day 👍🏻 Option to use the sister hotel (The Occidental) pool and slide facilities (and the all inc pool bar) Few shops and Pharmacy within a five minute walk as well as a few restaurants all reasonably priced.   In all honesty I would not class it as a 4 star more a 3.5, but I think holiday companies now base the star ratings on the features available and not the quality of the facilities etc. This may just be me.   What I will say is although with everything summarised we had a great holiday and made the most of what we had and what we were offered.   We also booked two excursions from the local provider in the hotel (Alibarba), we did Camel riding and quad bikes. Both great value for money (expect to get mega dusty on the quad bikes and take sun glasses. We took age range 8 to 60 on both trips and all enjoyed them.   If you book here I hope your overall experience is as good as ours 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻   We came at the end of May and had between 26 and 32 temp throughout the 10 days, all sun no clouds (apart from one random down which was overcast with showers).  Over all great holiday 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"

Location is great near to Sousse and port El Kantoui. Most staff are very friendly and can not do enough for you . A small tip goes a long way . Although there was a few staff members in the restaurant that ere neither friendly or helpful and made you feel like you was not wanted .The hotel is great value for money . The bar staff in the lobby and beach bar was great . Reception staff were very helpful and friendly.  The rules say that you was not allowed to reserve sund beds with towels and towels would be removed . Thus was not the case and sometimes it was difficult to get a sun bed . Apart from that we had we a had a lovely time and would return"

        "review_text": "Upon arrival, my partner realised he left his rucksack on the transfer and the reception staff were amazing and called the bus company to arrange for them to drop it off, making several calls throughout the day to sort this for us. The room is adequate. The beds are large but the mattresses a little firm as well as the pillows. The air conditioning practically useless, however we have been told by other travellers that the hotel will not switch it on until June 1st. The pool bar is a great feature although the pool itself is slightly on the small side and according to our teenage children; not deep enough. There is an idiot pool at the sister hotel next door (Occidental) which is deeper, however it is very stuffy in there. When you are sat around the pool you do get a lot of different staff walking around trying to sell you treatments and trips and you have to be firm when you do not want them as they will return and continue to ask. We have not used the gym so cannot comment, however looking at it from outside; it looks very modern and is always in use. The spa is very relaxing and the treatments are great; however you are asked several times that you leave a good tip.  Drinks are pretty standard for all inclusive. Food has been one of the best all inclusive we have experienced. There have been traditional staples daily plus a good variety of other dishes suitable for both adults and fussy children. One evening, the restaurant even provided live entertainment in the form of a saxophonist, alongside a feast of sushi and fresh fish dishes. The staff in the restaurant are incredible, they make an effort to get to know your drinks order and sit you at the same table and cannot do enough for you. The entertainment throughout the day is your usual mix of water aerobics and competitions such as darts and archery for the whole family. The evening shows have been mostly outdoors in the sister hotel and have consisted of mini disco and a show afterwards. Not all have been great, however the entertainment team are always incredible. They are engaging with everyone and bring a lot of fun and energy."

        "review_text": "Stayed at Marhaba club in Sousse. The hotel is not 4 star, 3 at best. Rooms are old, tired and dated, bathroom has tiles and discoloration to edge of bath and inside. Beds are not double but 2 singles pushed together. Food is edible but limited everything is repeated daily, the egg/omelette station is below par and the juices are terrible not fresh at all artificial tasting and really disappointing. The all inclusive alcohol was like water they used the cheapest vodka/rum/gin and brandy they have in their supermarket which I saw was 17 dinar (£4.20) and you cannot feel the effects. The gin isn't gin tastes like vodka and the glasses they provide are about 250ml. People bought large cups to get it filled. Deposit of £12 for the towel per one needed to be paid. We bought towels from gift shop as was only £3.50. and kept. One of the annoying things was in the morning before 9am cleaners will come in the room even if sleeping to take the towels away (have no idea why). Not to clean room. We would come back after breakfast room not clean and towels not back until late afternoon every day. No do not disturb sign either. They didn't clean the rooms they made bed and emptied bins. There was hot chocolate stain on table for 4 days up until we left that wasn't wiped off. Mosquitos so bring repellent as air conditioning not switched on until June. The access to swimming and gym is at the Occidental hotel which is a bit of a walk away. The snacks were a few cakes at the lobby. The beach bar serves no spirit just beer and wine On the positive the people were nice and attentive, entertainment was ok. If you like table tennis bring your own balls as you would hardly find any."

Kept me awake until 2.30am. Bring some earplugs and ask for a room nowhere near this and you will have a great time. Very clean everywhere and again all staff fantastic"

        "review_text": "Holiday in Marhaba Club resort is a real treat. Rooms are clean,with new towels every day. Staff always happy smiling and ready to help people to enjoy their holiday to fullest, going extra mile and advice on anything. Food is what you expect on all inclusive holiday, enough variety of different kind of foods and treats including ice cream at lunch and dinner time to satisfy anyone. Animation team on our side 3 lovely guys Rico,Mino and Tores joined by some other lovely animators at times are amazing, engaging and hard working people who entertain guests by the pool every day with games, activities and pool parties. Putting up entertaining show every night. Some in hotel lobby some bigger shows outside on other side of complex. Now I would like to comment on some negative reviews I seen before I visited. I did not experience any of stuff some people write in those,to the point I have to ask why people like this even go holidays. Hotel resort is beautiful and right at beachfront,just the short walk on path leading via resort will easily lead you there. Some people don't appreciate good place and hard work hotel staff do even if they were given holiday for free. Of course with busy place like this you will have to sometimes wait few minutes to get cuttlery on your table and plates don't just vanish the second you finish eating and who cares if there is no tea bags in the room. There are some buildings around currently not in use,but they obviously work on renovations and improvements there same as painting everything to make sure place looks nice and clean, I see management walking around planing where and what needs to be done,but it doesn't just happen over night logically. The people who work here are on their feet 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, have to deal sometimes with grumpy and rude guests,as I experienced on my own eyes. And that's the kind of people who write bad reviews. I was on few different holidays in different countries but this place convinced me to come back with my family. So big thanks to all staff in the hotel,you are doing great job."

Felt so safe letting my kids be independent and move around the resort freely. A great size with all the facilities so well laid out, perfect for our boys who were 7 and 8. The kids foam party was one of the most fun things our children have ever done on holiday and so well organised and manned. Staff were always kind friendly and welcoming, Ziko from the entertainment was brilliant and the beach security Rafik, his colleagues and life guards went above and beyond to accommodate us, have fun with our kids and provide fantastic service. Food was a little repetitive but always great quality and selection, pastries were incredible and a cheese panini from the sandwich corner was always a winner at lunchtime. Dinner at the Baia restaurant was also phenomenal, couldn’t fault it. Can’t wait to return to tui blue manar!"

        "review_text": "Dear Mr Walid Gharbi,  Thank you very much for our enjoyable holiday in Tui Blue Manar. Ananda B has written a review, 5 star, for the family experience (family of 8, 4 double rooms). I would like to comment on one unpleasant aspect encountered in the hotel. We took the trip to Bazar Tapis La Brise that was offered by the one of the two vendors who operate in the grounds of the hotel. Points to note: 1) The vendor made out he was associated with the hotel - not true. 2) Vendor stated that hotel cars would be used for transport - not true, two UNSAFE private vehicles were used. 3) Vendor stated that visit was to a carpet factory - not true, visit was to a shop. 4) Vendor stated that factory was Government owned - not true, a private shop. 5) Vendor stated that Bedouin women would be viewed making carpets - not true. One women in the shop gave very short demonstration. 6) After our visit I found that the shop had one star reviews from French tourists stating their bad experience. Shop name Bazar Tapis La Brise in Hammamet. 7) After our visit I reported the above to the Tui representative who then discussed this with her manager. 8) On the following day I was approached and questioned by the vendor in an unfriendly, intimidating manner (something had been said to him by the hotel). Due to this I did not raise the issue further until I was safely home. A good hotel full of very pleasant and friendly staff let down by one vendor (tout) allowed to operate in the hotel grounds.  My strong advise to guests is do not engage with the tout and do not go on the carpet tour. If you want a Tunisia carpet go to a reputable shop. Mr. Walid Gharbi, thank you for our stay in your hotel and I will let you consider the tout who adds nothing but takes away a lot. Best regards Robert B"

Food in glut tasteless not seasoned! I've never seen so much garbage thrown away by waiters, especially scavengers! The wine is undrinkable! The restaurant is unworthy of a so-called 4.5 star!

Snack bar and sandwich corner was great to grab some food if you're by the pool or beach.   Pools were so clean and nice, foam party was so much fun.   Beach was immaculate, soft white sand and clear blue water.    Our rooms was spotless, house keeping came and cleaned everyday and done an excellent job.   Entertainment was great, 7 year old loved it.   We left the resort twice to go to yasmine and Naubel, reception called taxi for us each time, always felt safe and loved exploring.   We were so sad to leave, but booking to come back in september. We have found our new home <3"

On the food side the cuisine is so mouthwatering that I will have to lose 2 kilos! Anyway, don't hesitate, rush!"

But above all, what truly stood out was the dedication, warmth, and professionalism of the entire team. We want to sincerely thank Mr. Bayrem and Mr. Lotfi at the reception, Mrs. Hada from housekeeping, the restaurant team, and also the gentleman who helped us with our luggage at the hotel entrance – always helpful, friendly, and full of care.  Thank you for turning this stay into a beautiful, heartfelt memory.  We’ll definitely be back!"

The suites, even the classic ones, are spacious and luxurious. We only realized the Dar Doora connection when making arrangement for a day room before our midnight flight.  The rooftop restaurant serves an international menu during the day, which was a nice change during Ramadan. Breakfast was delicious.  The spa was a plus —free hammam access for guests, a relaxing massage (though not deep tissue), great facial and manicure.  Dar El Jeld is an easy choice for luxury; Dar Doora is a solid lower-cost option."

There are plenty of shops, restaurants and things to see all around this Hotel. The staff are pleasant and efficient. The rooms and bath are large and the bath floor is heated. The rooms are large and comfortable and they generously flood you with fruits and chocolates daily which made me feel at home and wanted.  Their spa was good but the hammam portion needs better handling and I was not happy since I was left to fend for myself and constantly had to call someone for assistance.  Food at their restaurant is delicious and the views from the rooftop are a splendid sight. They also a Tunisian restaurant with the same name next door and it is well rated and need a booking.  You cannot go wrong with this hotel !"

I did the hammam and 60 min massage for about $58 USD. The aestheticians were fabulous and I walked out feeling renewed. I only wish they had more availability. Book your appointments when you book your room, since it is fully booked. The spa has yummy treats. My only suggestion is that book early, since they run low on amazing local treats.  The hotel rooms are suites. We had a bedroom, living room, and 1.5 bathrooms for about $178 USD. The places is immaculate and beautifully decorated. Chocolates and fruit are given at turn down. I wish they switched it upon arrival.   The restaurants are divine. We ate on the roof which is casual and less than the restaurant where we ate last year. Try both, since it is a very different vibe.  Take the hotel transfer service. I usually don't, but taxis aren't allowed in the Medina and we found ourselves dragging our luggage. The premium for the transfer is worth it especially if arriving at night.  I highly recommend this property. My goal is to find more properties like this globally that deliver exceptional quality at a fair price."

        "review_text": "Went to the Spa on Sunday for a manicure, massage and facial treatment. The cosmeticians are faaar from being professional as its visible on the photo with deplorable nailpolish. The quality used for the products is embarrassing. Not even a base coat has been applied. Eventhough not in the hamman itself it was hot like hell. I mentioned several times to turn on the Ac and that heat harms me cause of my medical condition with multiple sclerosis but nothing and it was just me and my sister there at that time, so no risk someone else could \"freeze\". Viewing the price and honestly even for the tenth of the price an impudence rarely seen"

        "review_text": "Dar El Jeld Hotel and Spa has a beautiful architeture and is situated in one of the best parts of the Medina. It positions itself as a luxury Hotel and SPA. This might be true for the Hotel part. However this is far from being reality when it comes to the SPA. If one pays this prices for a SPA (675 Dinars for two people `100 euro each) in Tunisia one might think that you will be welcomed with at least a glass of water while you are in the waiting room which was not the case. You would also expect to be in the hands of highly professional beauty staff using good to high quality products, which unfortunately is not the case (manicure / nail polish was very poor). The girls are lovely but lack experience. All in all being at the spa was nice but value for money was far from being good. If you sell luxury clients need to get that!"

As per google, it is 1800 m2.  - the atmosphere and people who work there are really nice people and very helpful. Of course if you speak French or Arabic would help a bit more.   - The animation team is absolutely the best. Every day there are so many activities and in the evening the entertainment and dancing. Loved the whole experience, and they are very helpful. Shouout to Manel and Maggie they are exceptional. Their dedication and sense of humour and dancing style made whole stay different."

Has been a fabulous break away from the UK in this family friendly hotel and even though our group was all adults we can't fault the hotel at all. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, facilities are spot on with a great pool with a swim up bar. A stones throw from the beach as well. All the staff have been so friendly and helpful from the waiting staff in the dining room, bar staff who keep you refreshed with a great selection of drinks on the all inclusive. Special mention to Oumymq who is part of the animation team who is an absolute diamond. She's been so helpful and friendly and it went a long way to making the stay so enjoyable. Kudos to the rest of the animation team as well, it's a tough job but the activities help break up the day.  Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of coming to Tunisia and for an all inclusive break it can't be knocked."

All the staff do, but you obviously make bonds with certain ones quickly!  The animation guys are ace, didn't get all their names but Oumyma, mygi, and soleil were really friendly, helpful and fun! Pool is SOOO good, sun all day pretty much whenever your lounger is, beach a stones throw away.  Easy to get to from the airport. Only downside was the air con was broken apparently in the whole hotel for our stay, made it very warm at night in the room, but luckily could keep door open and the net curtain over. Didn't really change the heat, and definitely needs fixing asap!  Cleaners are all very lovely and rooms are clean.  The odd bit of maintenance needs doing in rooms/around the hotel with lighting, but over all a wonderful stay 💛💛"

From the moment we arrived, we were seduced by the enchanting setting of the hotel, nestled in the heart of a beautiful palm garden, with direct access to a dream beach.  The staff is simply exceptional: welcoming, professional and always ready to help with a smile. Many thanks to the whole team for their kindness throughout our stay.  The room was spacious, clean, well decorated, with very comfortable bedding. We particularly enjoyed the calm of the place, perfect to recharge.  The buffets are varied, well presented and delicious. There is something for everyone, and Tunisian specialties are a real treat. Breakfast is also very complete, with a wide choice of fresh products.  The pool is huge and very nice, and the thalassotherapy center is a real plus to relax and enjoy the stay to the fullest. The private beach is superb, with its fine sand and turquoise waters.  It was our first time at Djerba Plaza, and certainly not the last. We leave with memories full of head and only one desire: come back very quickly! And thank you again to Erwan for his warm welcome and always smile."

They all go above and beyond to make sure you have the best holiday & constantly have your drinks replaced.  Overall I would definitely go back to this hotel - highly recommend.  The beach is lovely white sand but when the sea is choppy it’s quite dirty as me and my partner found out when getting on the jet ski’s and we’re filthy!"

Embedded in the card game to set the mood, also at parties, they make us sport on request oriental dance classes, stretching, table tennis and dart! The bartenders take care! The cook for our outings prepared sandwiches on request when it didn’t seem usual but he does it with good heart. The cuisine is local so spicy, but there is white pasta, thankfully! In addition the place is very clean and very secure. The housekeepers we were in the little care in our rooms every day while we did not tidy up too much ... There is an indoor heated pool and there is the outdoor pool protected from the wind thanks to the cypress and architecture. There might be some things to complain about, but considering the price and the kindness and attention we get, it’s worth 5. Just the soundproofing in the room requires balls."

        "review_text": "Exceptional experience. The hotel has covered every possible aspect of hospitality on a family holiday (within their reasonable control).   Food? Superb Drinks? Flowing Facilities? Polished  Staff? Friendly, multilingual, always ready to help. The Animation/Entertainment staff in particular  are friendly and engaging, but never pushy. Every single member of staff we interacted with was at pains to make sure our son (5) was looked after, and having fun  Are there down sides? Yes.  Are they within the control of the hotel? No.   Insect bites are a pain, plastic in the sea and debris on the beach isn't ideal. But the staff are out on the beach every morning clearing and cleaning and making it as enjoyable as possible for everyone. Other reviews have dubbed the food as boring, or repetitive, or not hot enough, but ultimately this is the nature of buffet dining for a diverse multinational audience of vastly varying ages.   But there is nothing that can be expected of the hotel to change these very minor issues.   Further massive credit to the team of lifeguards. Attentive, engaged, and always working to look after the countless children on the water slides. Our 5yo tripped and grazed his knee and Emile carried him down 2 flights of stairs, insisted on disinfecting his leg and applying plasters, and wouldn't let him go until he was sure he was safe, happy again, and had a parent to hand."

In fact one day on beach they walked around spoke to guests and not once spoke to there own staff 😑 yet the entertainment team fantastic 👏🏾 👍🏾. Food was great service was on point. Cocktails was very watered down you had ask for more alcohol 🍸 😉 Please interduce pot for cups of tea not these cups that can't even make decent cuppa tea and real English Tea bags please. In corridors there are no security cameras only by lifts hotel didn't find that an issue."

        "review_text": "Just returned from a week at the hotel. We had a junior suite / the room was massive ( too big really and some wasted space) it had a sea view, but you also had a view of the roof. The bed was not comfortable it was hard, however I asked at reception if they could do something and they did put a topper in it, which was better. The hotel is plush in places, but some renovations are required. I saw some areas where there was damage, but tbh this didn’t impact in my stay. The restaurant was good, the food was really nice and I’ve read on other reviews that it was repetitive / this is a buffet, they are always the same, there was plenty to choose ( grilled meat/ fish/ Tunisian cuisine/ Indian/ pasta / pizza / fresh salad / and various desserts. The food was lovely. They have 3 themed restaurants- these are quite basic, and tbh could be improved.  The Italian for example- a set menu with two main courses ( who wants that)  Have a choice and add a salad and garlic bread! We didn’t go to the other themed restaurants as the menu was limited. The staff are the best asset to this hotel, All were attentive and couldn’t do more for you, especially Yassine in the restaurant and Mohamed in the bar. The beach is lovely but again they should clear the seaweed early or late on the day, no one wants to dodge the JCB walking along the beach.   The beach staff were excellent as well, the animation staff were jolly and they did interrupt your dinner, but I didn’t mind this they are drumming up support for the 9.30 show. I didn’t really like the dancing that they did but some people really enjoyed it - do it wasn’t for me but that’s fine. I would recommend it was a lovely week away."

        "review_text": "From the moment we arrived we were very very well looked after. All the staff literally always had a smile on their faces and nothing, and I mean nothing was too much trouble for any of them. My friend has never done all inclusive before and the choice alone at the bar overwhelmed her a bit so the gorgeous barman made her a special and unique cocktail which was called Gills cocktail and that is what she asked for each time she wanted it and it was made the same everytime.   The food was exquisite,  no cross contamination to  be seen, beautifully presented, a great choice and literally something for all tastes.   The pool was lovely with plenty of loungers and parasols. The water was a little chilly but I guess that is because it is the  beginning of the season and it hasn't had enough sun to heat it up yet. There is a great poolside service and if you are that way inclined, you could literally park yourself in the morning and not move again till the sun went down.  Rooms - we had the standard room but it was perfectly adequate, the shower was good, air con effective I did have a really loud buzzing noise coming out of my wardrobe. I brought it to housekeeping attention and it was delbt with immediately. Housekeeping themselves were totally brilliant and our rooms were kept in tip top condition.    Entertainment - i have never really  been one for the evening entertainment  but my travel companion pursued me to go all but one night and I have to say I really enjoyed every night. Dancing and generally losing your inhibitions a bit, and nobody cares cause we are all on holiday and having a blast. The entertainment team work damn hard all day and all evening sometimes I wander how they stay awake and so energetic  with the ridiculous long hours they work.   So 8 nights gone in a flash of utter joy and happiness. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will be talking about it and the fabulous staff for a while to come. I already miss them and I hope to return to see them all again in the not too distant future.  Bravo - Absolutely fantastic xx"

        "review_text": "The hotel was a nice hotel, clean and looks very like the pictures. There were a few down falls to it. 1.The buffet restaurant was average, it felt like it was really repetitive 2. The themed restaurant (Italian) menu was a set menu no choices but the wait times were ridiculous for simple food. We waited 30 mins from having our starter which was only tomato and mozzarella to geting our main course we had to ask where it was. They then skipped one of the courses for us. 3. The drinks on the first day were great proper cocktails, they then changed to pre made mixes which just tastes like water 4. The anamation team were very annoying, they would come to you while you were eating dinner and interrupt your meal to get to come to the entertainment nights. They also kept making the same comments to my partner about him being muscle and tall. It got annoying for him because it was every day the same people.  We did make a complaint at the hotel regarding the drinks and restaurant and they upgraded us to a prestige room. There wasn't anything really prestige about it it was the same as our first room just had a smart tv. The prestige bar area you get access to isn't very special either. Jaccuzi that don't work and seemed quite dirty when in it.  Overall the holiday was OK but the hotel definitely needs to take some things into consideration.  Also a beef burger was served to me with no beef it was only a slice of salami on it.  I would return however I would hope some of the points I've made would be taken into consideration"

All the employees whether it be: baggage handler, reception, housekeepers, bar and buffet staff really all are constantly at the small care it is really remarkable and most pleasant. The service around the pool or by the beach is a big plus especially with children. The friendly animation team beautiful energy. Our daughter had a blast at the mini disco and the color party. The staff at this hotel really love their jobs and do it wonderfully! Thank you all very much.  The buffet is amazing every day different dishes there is really something for everyone. Breakfast is fabulous fresh juice pressed before our eyes nothing like to start a beautiful day at this hotel.   Just a shame the indoor pool is not heated.  The room we had a garden view, the staff planted new trees all week and it's a good thing because it was a bit empty. Great bedding! Tv French chains mini bar well supplied for small and large. The bathroom is spacious just a lot of humidity which leaves room for a little mold and finishes leave a little to be desired but considering the time spent in this room it is not much. A big bravo to this army of people who make this hotel such a warm and welcoming place because considering the surface it is quite a job.  The hotel beach is really next door it is very clean it is well maintained and well guarded. For children there is everything you need beautiful outdoor structures as an interior in case of bad weather. The staff speaks French perfectly well. Great stay I can only highly recommend this hotel."

The food was delicious and a great variety, with some of your usual (chips, pizza...), lots of fresh fruit and veg, freshly made pasta, handmade deserts and pastries, and lots of lovely local dishes to try. There is also a Tunisian restaurant that is really nice, and it was great trying the local food.  There are nice pools, a lovely and clean beach, and plenty of sun loungers. There is a watersports shop on the beach where you can do activities for an additional cost, which was well priced.   Overall, this was a great place, and the staff made it that extra bit special and truly enjoyable. Definitely worth the visit."

Pool is very spacious and pool area is constantly clean by always smiling and very helpful lady Maha. Barr staff are excellent and will bring you drinks to your lounger. Massive thank you to Isam who was brilliant and took very good care of us. Rooms are spacious and cleaned daily. The restaurant has a large variety of food every meal time. Food was delicious and staff were brilliant and very attentive. FANTASTIC ANIMATION TEAM - Mogli, Smiley, Mino, Heidi (dont remember all names).Every day was different,  full of games and laugh. Great activities during the day (aqua aerobic, archery, darts, mini golf) and night (bingo, karaoke, theme nights). I was not bored for a second. Animation team were fantastic.  They are working so hard for so many hours to make the experience worth while. Staff will go above and beyond to make every guest's stay unforgettable. The only minus I found during our stay is lack of staff in reception. There is only one person working there so if you have any query to be resolved, awaiting time is quite long."

        "review_text": "If you want to enjoy your holiday don’t book this place. From the check in it was bad. The reservations manager ruined the stay from the start, so rude and unaccountable when booking wasn’t found that he confirmed that He made. Instead he was laughing behind the receptionist who was clearly in distress that she couldn’t find the booking.  Rude racist staff that ruin whole experience. Very accommodating for Caucasian guests and you can see that. Scowl when asking for water or glasses for the water which they stomp down on table. It’s almost like anything is too great of an ask. Wait around 20 mins for refill of cups or food at buffet. Ramzi and Ahmad were so rude and disrespectful to my family in the restaurant that managers had to intervene but even then they stand around bitching and complaining right in front of you. Pictures are incredibly misleading and the rooms do not look like images shown. Rooms are barely cleaned and towels look like they are flunged into rails. They don’t wipe or clean anything nor make the beds- nor change the sheets or glasses. On check out they don’t even ask how was your stay maybe because they already know it was a bad experience.   Things they don’t tell you:   No kettles included in rooms- need to pay 5Dinars per day therefore no cutlery or cups in room and if you ask the bar they will not give you any.   Iron- can rent for 1 hour when you pay a deposit like 40 dinars which they do give back allegedly   They do not provide towels for the pool or beach   Air con does not work till June so bear that in mind as you will also be dying of heat in the room  Only nice thing is grounds of hotel. Food is poor, no customer service and rooms don’t get cleaned. Beach is very dirty- red flag beach so can’t swim in it. AVOID"

        "review_text": "Got back on Sunday from a weeks stay, hotel itself was nice, pool big and kids slides were open a couple of the times we walked round but they arent the best little one kept getting stuck on one of them as there wasnt enough water to push him down and got a bit of a mark on him from getting stuck, he loved the big pool so we just stared there. Signs all over to say no saving sunbeds but of course people did so it was a bit annoying!!   animation team were great - always trying to get people involved and were brilliant with kids. Kids disco every night at around 2030 was okay just very repetitive songs but i suppose thats standard. Then had a show on after at 2130 which varied from like bingo to dance shows etc  food was meh, there is something for everyone i think but i lived off spaghetti and chips and a bit of salad all week - probably took more precaution as I am pregnant so didnt want to go too far into the unknown lol... KFC around the corner lol   there's a fridge in the room which is handy as we used it to keep bottles of water etc in there - no dilute or anything for kids and fruit juice very limited so went to the shop and got our little one some from there and just kept it in the fridge and took his water bottle so he always had something to drink. I didn't have alcohol as pregnant so cant advise on that but hubs had the larger and said it was crap as tasted watered down.  no air con until 1st June so room was an absolute sweat box, especially first few days as reached 34 degrees which was just ridiculous!   left the hotel a couple of times and got harassed constantly and nearly kidnapped by a taxi driver when we asked to go into Sousse centre so then avoided going out from then on... There is also a shop at the hotel which sold pretty much everything from floaties for the pool to suncream, clothes, and gifts and snacks.  hotel staff themselves were lovely and polite, constantly saw the cleaners going round and cleaning up - no issues with our room, beds made every day with fresh towels.   Transfer time from Airport to hotel was about 40 mins so not bad. Went with EasyJet however didn't see one rep there once which is a bit of a shame as any issues there was no one to really help with any situations."

There are so many positives to mention, the Aqua Aerobics, Swimming Pool, Sauna/ Fish Sauna and the beach which is walking distance also has its own activities like Paragliding. The receptionists were very accommodating, a few people to mention, Wiem, Randa, Hamza and Walid. Thanks to the security at the Hotel, we felt very safe as 2 single females.

On the food side, there is a choice: the buffets are varied and the dishes are good.  The atmosphere is great thanks to a team of animation at the top, funny and always motivated, whether during the day or during the evening shows.  Many thanks to them for a successful stay! I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would be happy to come back."

        "review_text": "As I wrote for the other reviews, the real discovery was the beauty of Tunisia, both for the places and for the kindness and helpfulness of the natives. The Resort is very nice, a true 5 star all inclusive and boasts 3 swimming pools directly on the sea, 3 bars, various restaurant rooms and a beautiful SPA. Deck chairs and umbrellas are your choice and even if you go a little later you will always find a seat, maybe not right in the front row, and in case you need the lifeguards are very happy to help you find a seat. The food for us Italians, apart from the delicious and varied breakfast, is not really the top, as the is too spicy and repetitive. A special mention goes to the cooking of veal and grilled fish. The pasta is badly cooked. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with international TV and very efficient mini bar, with two bathrooms each. We for personal reasons had it changed and in less than an hour we were given a new room. The staff is always friendly and willing to help, several times we had taxis called to go downtown... But the real gem is the Spa, we spent a magnificent afternoon, the relaxing massage of one hour was wonderful.  One thing to emphasize is the care for the customer: On the evening of my birthday they made me find a delicious cake with a lot of surprise. Thank you."

The reception is warm and professional, the rooms are closer to a standard 4 French stars than a palace. The restaurant offers a quality service with “panagrastic” appetizers, the welcome is also very warm.  The indisputable black spot is breakfast where the welcome is execrable, the waiters turn their heads not to respond to your requests, the management waits with arms crossed....and at 10am very precise we put you squarely out, everything is dismantled.  This picture ruins everything else. Too bad."

        "review_text": "Wow where do I start, the first hotel room we were allocated didn’t have a door handle and when I lent over the balcony wall I was covered in white paint, new clothes, no wet sign. We were moved to different room, the safe was broken but thought we would just hide valuables or take them with us.   The pool area is really nice and the staff are happy to help and there is a nice atmosphere there, snacks aren’t too bad there either. Probably the best part of the holiday.   The food/ buffet area is terrible on the 3rd day I suffered from food poisoning from uncooked chicken.   My son ended up with a black eye from the water park because a piece of apparatus was broken, no sign or tape, nothing to say is was broken. The staff did apologise but there was no first aid or accident book. ( I put ice on it myself to reduce the swelling)   I kept noticing my hotel room smelt like smoke then we came back to it after a day at the pool, we were gone from 8am- 4pm each day we were here. Then on the 4th day I noticed a packet of cigarettes had been taken from an unopened pack of 200 which I was taken home for a friend so I moved these into my suitcase, the 5th day I was packing my suitcase and I noticed another packet had gone. So the cleaner must have a thing for menthol cigarettes.   Overall please don’t go here."

        "review_text": "We have not long got back from our holiday in Tunisia. We all spent a week at the Mahdia Beach & Aqua Park, and we found all staff at the hotel to be very friendly, from the cleaners to the animation team. The animation team need some praise as they really go out there way to make you feel welcome, learn all guests' names, and get you involved in all activities.   The hotel is very beautiful inside and kept very clean. The atmosphere by the pool was very relaxing, and the dj set was very good. Nobody was fighting over sunbeds. There was plenty for everybody. We really enjoyed the food near the pool area. The omlettes, fresh orange juice,kebabs, chips, tuna roll, crepes, and donuts were all very nice. The restaurant itself was a buffet style and it was up and down, some nights we got tired of the same thing and some things such as rice and potatoes wasn't cooked as to how we would of liked. The paella was delicious and the cakes. We really enjoyed the cocktails inside the hotel itself, and some of the liquors were nice. We did go out of the hotel some nights to eat. We really liked 'Roys' the food and drinks were lovely.   The evening entertainment at the hotel was good, it was something different each night. We liked the light show and Mj show.   The trips we went on were very good. We did quad biking, a visit to the colosseum, and we went on a pirate ship.   The hotel has its own private beach. It has the most beautiful sand. There are lots of sunbeds which are not at any extra cost. We felt very safe as there were a lot of security around the hotel and on the beach.  Our room was cleaned everyday and we really liked the walk in shower. The beds were comfortable and we had a balcony that we sat on some evenings before bed to relax.   The inside pool was lovely and we all enjoyed the water park, lots of fun!  Thank you to all staff at the hotel for a pleasant stay."

Room below standard, phones across whole hotel apparently do not work so could not call reception. Balcony doors do not shut or lock  properly, mini fridge on floor rather than in the built in unit it should be. No air con.  Reception very very rude and no respect for women at all.  Awful start…. Do not come here without a man, I can’t believe I’m having to wright that sentence!"

        "review_text": "Before going I read so many mixed reviews, some didn’t like the food, others the cleanliness but in my humble opinion this hotel is absolutely lovely! I travelled with my mum and my two little girls and we loved everything! There is so much food to choose from (but I am a massive foodie and not fussy) and it is available all day. My girls loved being able to get food that they liked all day. Aqua park is just the right size for little people, without you losing them or running around looking where they are. Room was clean and towels changed daily (not a single cockroach was noted during our 10 day stay) Now let me focus on the service we received. ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE who works at that hotel was AMAZING! They work long hours and deal with a variety of clients and yet are always smiling, always polite, always willing to help. All waiters couldn't do enough for us, all life guards are alert and on point (I witnessed one life guard save a little toddler from drowning and his speed was out of this world!!), the animation team are brilliant! I must give an absolute special mention to Mimi and Ranyme, these girls are diamonds! Their work at kids club and kids disco left some special memories for my girls to treasure. They even let my ladies be their assistants on stage on our last night there. The beach was clean and beautiful! My family will be back to Mahdia Beach and I hope to see some of the amazing people who work there again!"

Little dedication to Rio, slim chaidi , Fernando, Willy and all the others.  Regarding the equipment and the environment, the pools are clean beautiful , a little cool the first days but it is normal we are only at the beginning of the season. The beach is beautiful, merchants are shipped by security to ensure the tranquility of holidaymakers. The rooms we had lack a little refreshing... The bathtub leaks, has trouble draining water, the beds were not made every day...   Small flat on the aquapark, it is outside the hotel, drinks and food are paid despite the all inclusive formula... Otherwise it is more than enough.  About the food, we ate well. Snack open from 10:18 am , pancake donuts all day. There is not a huge choice but the taste is present 😋   Second downside for the ambient noise especially in the evening, some holidaymakers abuse a little too much of the all inclusive and become disturbing for those who just want to spend a quiet evening with their children without hearing howling at the end of fields. A little more intervention by the security service would be desirable.  I think I summarized a good part of the stay and the hotel 🙃"

Amazing, very friendly and welcoming. The service is excellent, the maintenance staff is adorable and the animation team! Legend. I have befriended many people and I can only say good things about them. The food was delicious. I am usually difficult, but they offered a wide choice of dishes, from beef spaghetti to cuttlefish ink! It sounds awful, but it was really delicious. The building is beautiful, it is a nice place to spend time with friends met on site or to sit and work. Animations. I can't tell you how amazing and unique it is to have an entertainment team at the hotel. These people danced, sang, organized entertainment.  You were able to learn dances to fun songs and have fun. There is an adorable DJ who can put on the songs you want, and many great people who show a big smile for you to have a great time!"

All in all we have had a great time here."

        "review_text": "I loved the food, but for children they could of had more selection, as the twins I were with have autism, so kids with this, are fussy. Apart from that the hotel is very clean, the cleaners are lovely.  The Animation Team The boss Mido, speaks many languages, and puts together the entertainment, The Naughty, but cheeky Simo, he should be called wicked and thats in a nice way, he entertained us and everyone around, so beware people, he's lots of fun, the beautiful Doussa, very helpful, even went for an after drink with her, she helped in all ways she could. Of course  Nader, with his hair, smile and his cheeky side, great dancer to. The wonderful GiGi, absolutely amazing with the children,  with her crafts and toys for all ages, the kids miss her, that says it all with tears and cuddles.  And Amine, they call him Giraffe, what a lovely man, fun, enjoyed dancing. Tho the team are not professional, actors, dancers the entertainment was brilliant, which was all down to Mido, he loves his job, but the work they all put into it, you can only praise them.  The bar staff were brilliant, I have never been to such a home felt hotel, tho small, it was ideal, as all the staff helped in their own ways. I'd highly recommend, and I will certainly go back, I know some people have already booked next year and going for 3 weeks next time.  Yes I would do 3 weeks myself to.  Highly recommend"

Thank you for everything, especially you Foufa! Our son really loves you and to this day he still asks where Foufa is. Our daughter has become very friendly with Sunny and Sainab. It didn't matter at all that our kids only speak Czech. They found their way to each other.  Our big thanks also go to the others, not only to the animation team, the very nice and helpful maid, the receptionist and the really helpful, smiling and hardworking waiters and the best pasta chef right on the beach.  Tip - it would be good to focus on the cleanliness of the kids club, the safety of the climbing frames, the cleanliness of the beach and maybe find a way to not use so much disposable plastic on a daily basis!"

A little special nod to Soulef (who looked after our room 2102) who surprised us with his decorations. Pleasant, kind and smiling person. I recommend the hotel 1000 percent. On the other hand, only downside with Karim (world tourism representative) who once sold us his excursions, remained indifferent throughout the stay. Did not tell us about the operation of the hotel, gave us no explanation, which is a shame. It does not represent the atmosphere of the hotel which is however perfect. For us, this is a negative. Apart from that, congratulations to all and thank you for your welcome."

A big thank you to Mabrouka who cleaned and managed our rooms perfectly and always with a smile. Evening Entertainment was good especially for the little ones. The negatives, the rooms have a separate toilet with the basin in the main room. This is very annoying especially at night when someone else is sleeping. The swimming pools are freezing even in 30 degree heat. They are not heated therefore the kids didn't enjoy it and barely jumped in.  Even the indoor pool wasn't heated although the hotel insisted that it was.  The private section of the beach is clean.  The food apart from breakfast is very poor quality."

        "review_text": "I stayed at this Lovely Hotel from the 11th of May for 7 nights with my Friend & Daughter All Inclusive. The Hotel was modern & we felt safe as you had to go through the security gates to get in, also through security when you arrive with your luggage at the Hotel. Our room was nice, modern & spacious. The shower was spacious, lots of storage space, iron & ironing board in the wardrobe. There was a mini fridge with a 1L bottle of water & a large flat screen TV. We stayed in room 141 pure sunshine from 6am in the morning on the balcony and the view of the beach & the hotel next door which i don't think is in operation. The staff were so accommodating and could not do anymore for us such lovely people. We always talk to the staff as we are social people. The food lots of choice something for everyone, and everything I ate was nice no complaints. There is entertainment every evening. The cleaner came everyday a nice elderly lady who was nice. When sunbathing you can order drinks and the waiter will bring them to you or you can go to the pool bar. The beach is over the foot bridge 1 mins walk from the pool area. We done the Jet ski's with Z who is situated just as you walk onto the beach.   Special thank you to Yazziz & Yassine who looked after us so well, and accommodated us with late check out. The only thing i would say is some of the Jacuzzi's could be heated as the pools are not."

        "review_text": "Hilton  Pros - modern decor. Nice beach.   Cons - poor service and here’s why;  1. There are lots of staff rushing around but not doing much - dirty / uncleared tables - Had to repeatedly ask waiters to clear dirty tables in the canteen (worse than a school hall).  2. You’re lucky if you get offered a drink in the canteen or terrace. Again there are lots of young (mostly male) staff rushing around but not really serving guests. Although I note female, younger guests do get served fairly quickly.   3. The room was cleaned but there were hairs on the floor which were not ours! .  4. The sink blocked and we had to ask for repair (not repaired and we had to use the lever under the sink to unblock manually).  5. The towel holder glued to the shower come off (not repaired)  6. The bedding wasn’t changed at all during our week stay.   Food  - plenty of it but tasteless and limited hours:  1. Food was repetitive  2. On arrival at 10pm no food available. No room service.  Usually when I’ve stayed at other 5 star hotels options are available for guests.    Location - nice beach no amenities nearby and very dirty  1. Do not go here if you like to get out for a walk or visit a nearby coffee shop/ bar restaurant. There aren’t any. The hotel is surrounded by derelict / abandoned building projects.   2. The whole area and surrounding town / Monastir is very dirty. There is rubbish strewn everywhere.  We went to look at the nearby flamingo site. It is surrounded by rubbish and a rubbish dump.   Overall - I wouldn’t book this hotel again unless there are major changes to the service and operation.  I would go back to Tunisia as the people are lovely  just not here to this hotel. I recommend really considering this place if you want a nice vacation this is not 5 star Hilton."

Like I said all the staff are amazing and I wish I could name them all, some that are extra special are, Bilal, Skilla, Marmado, Aleena, Ghiza Hammed, there were so many more that made our trip so special.

And this property is really in the Top 3 in terms of overall amenities. Staff: Pleasant on all floors, be it housekeepers, bartenders, receptionists, SPA people, room waiters, really perfect, smile and kindness. Meals: Interesting concept, in the morning breakfast in a place where the “Tastes” view of the main pool take place, possibility of eating out. In the main dining hall, free placement, in the evening on the other hand 2 Services, 1 from 18:30 to 19:30 and 1 from 20:00 to 21:00 fixed placement, indeed as soon as you arrive a table will be designated and you will keep it throughout the stay for evening meals, really nice which allows to have always the same server.  -Bedroom: Spacious, well appointed and always clean  Bars: There are everywhere, quality alcohols far from the other establishments that offer alcohols sometimes undrinkable, downright a Cocktail card available really TOP!!   - Buffets: really well, it is true that the quantities are much less numerous than in the other hotels, but the products are REALLY quality, in the morning the pastries are fresh, fruit pressed by hand, hot bread, with all meals dishes redone on site live, really the food is quality, maybe a little less choice than in the other establishments but we eat better.  SPA: No treatments in this SPA, only massages, I would say not bad service but could do better, massages are more of 30’ rather than 50’, on the other hand good pleasant and caring masseuses. Beach: Superb, with deckchair available, a beach attendant, a security guard who watches the few beach vendors to do some business.  - Animators / Atmosphere: Really TOP!!! Friendly and very good at animation, not insistent with people who want to stay quiet. Really TOP shows, superb atmosphere, foam evening in the pool, games the day really the Class!!!  Finally, really nice hotel whether for a trip with family, friends or in Love. I recommend"

        "review_text": "Group of 3 friends who paid £400 each for a week here.   The hotel was clean, rooms tidied daily, fresh bath towels provided daily, beach is beautiful, pool area has plenty sunbeds and fresh foods available at every meal.   The staff absolutely make this hotel, with Ali from the shish place one of the most kindest and caring people we have ever met. He walked us to the disco and helped our friend who has poor mobility one night, and it was upsetting to see one of the animation team shouted at him, saying we were telling him to f*** off, and we weren’t. Tried to find a manager to inform this was untrue but couldn’t locate one. I would be grateful if a manager could reply to this review and advise they are aware of this now.   Often the only time we seen a manager was when they were shouting at waiting staff/bar staff. This was horrible to witness as most of these are young boys trying their best. To expect two staff to collect all the glasses and replenish guests drinks is a staffing issue, not their issue. These guys are so grateful to have jobs, it’s not nice to see them being shouted at.   The 5 bars as advertised is only available from 1st June, which is something I will take up with love holidays. The beach bar opened on 26th May, which meant we enjoyed time at the beach without having to walk 5 minutes each way to refill our glasses.   The food is alright. Breakfast is very egg dominated, with fresh omelettes made to order available. Lunch is the best meal, which was echoed by other guests. Dinner is rather disappointing, with the same number of dishes available at lunchtime but it feels like less selection.   The location is beautiful, as I said the beach is gorgeous. Taxis to sousse are readily available and we spent most nights in the Hard Rock Cafe nearby.   If you are looking for 4/5 star Europe, this is not the one, it is more like a 3 star, however I firmly believe nobody looks after their guests like the Tunisians which is what made our holiday."

The main complaint is the reception area and staff, are so rude and un helpful, when we first checked in we were rushed to checked in.\"hurry fill this in\" \"you need to send us the reservation through email\"  We been told the indoor pool is closed due to it being summer its closed, we had friends that were ginger and fair skinned and wanted to swim in an indoor pool we were told we weren't allowed. After spending nearly 9k over 2 times.   The food is repetitive, bland and horrible,  The animation team only want you to play dart and silly games like that. And don't do much.  The large area on the website with the stage is just dirty and full of old rancid couches  The amenities like mini gold is run down and dead grass same as the tennis court [which i didn't even know they had] the restaurant you have to book even know its in the hotel.  The WiFi doesn't reach all the rooms.  Bar drinks are waters down with very cheap alcohol.  Travelling around the local shops all you get is bombarded with [hello hello very good price good price] after telling the locals no your hounded and often not allowed to leave the shops until you kick up a fuss.   Rooms aren't cleaned properly the sheets aren't changed frequently."

No water one day no toilets the next day the entertainment team I feel bad for but they were terrible and had no interest in the kids what so ever only the adults they wanted to annoy all day every day 😕 m we were all inclusive and you could taste the water in all the drink. You can drink the vodka straight all day and you wouldn't even have a slight be on a dunt off it 😂 realy shocking for what we paid."

Went to the market with an employee of the hotel who said other clients were going then said they hadn't turned up which left him and I so I told him I wanted to go back to the hotel only to be told I had to give him more money and was then put in a taxi alone back to the hotel. The whole experience of the hotel was intimidating and spoiled my stay in Tunisia, use a different hotel, check recent reviews."

We went in May when pool slides, pool bar etc were not open as their season starts from June onwards which we were not aware and found disappointing.  Waiters, kitchen staff are all brilliant. Special mention about their Guest Manager, Manel, who is absolutely fantastic. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was seamless and enjoyable. From helping with local recommendations and handling a few unexpected issues with efficiency and care, her support made a big difference. Manel was always approachable, attentive, and genuinely committed to making our experience exceptional."

Spent a lot of time at reception complaining. Told there was no hot water for over 12 hours. Bed not changed for the week we were there.Tiny veranda.  Drink…. awful all watered down. Spent £72 for litre of Smirnoff in restaurant across from hotel. (Smashed mine at airport)  Pool snacks… None, whatever was left in restaurant got put by the bar. Pizza and bread  Entertainment… good if you’re under 5. Same repetitive music …. Atmosphere… poor .. Nothing to do at night. In fact nothing to do at all. All in all I would not return to this hotel at all. How it got 4* 5* on trip advisor I do not know. I came home with 42 bites. Some really sore ones.  Shambles of a hotel. Some staff ok . No bank machine . I could go on an on …..  Grandsons enjoyed themselves so suppose that’s a bonus."

        "review_text": "Not long returned from this hotel and i have to say that this was NOT a 4 star hotel experience, 2 star at best. None of the pool or beach bars were open once, no hotel entertainment except for kids which was terrible. The room was basic with rusty pipes around the bath. The hairdressers and beauty spa ladies have no diplomas up in the shop and were clearly untrained for the job for which i had to request my money back for the awful hairstyle they gave me. It was advertised as no smoking allowed in the cocktail bar that was never open yet people were allowed to use it as a smoking area which could be smelled throughout the hotel including the room i stayed in which smelt like stale smoke the whole time. The food was okay but repetitive, very limited selection especially for breakfast which was only fried eggs and omelette or cereal. The waiters and staff were lovely, very polite and friendly and the poor maids who clean the room as best they could with what little cleaning equipment they had didnt change the bed sheets once in the 10 nights i stayed aswell as that the towels are threadbare and no good. On one of the days there was a notice on the resturant door that there would be no hot water anywhere in the hotel from 8am until midnight so nobody could shower or bath, the next day there was a sewage problem and no water to flush the toilets aswell as taht there was only 3 toilets available quite a way from the bar and resturant area. My friend and I payed nearly £2000 for this 10 night holiday and it was a disaster from start to finish. I love Tunisia have been 10 times and will return again but never to this hotel. Avoid at all costs."

Our room was ready 1 hours early so we were grateful for that. The room itself was spotless. Comes with a TV with limited channels, a mini fridge to keep your drinks cool and quite a powerful shower! Beds are lovely and comfy. Maid makes up the room every day and provides a fresh big bottle of water (no need to tip). Staff are literally so attentive and are so grateful for a tip both at the bar and at dinner service, if you are a polite person they will look after you in kind. The food was tasty and a good variety, if you ask at breakfast for a steak for dinner they will prepare one for you for dinner in the evening.  Please bare in mind that the tourist tax is per person, per room, per night so it can be quite costly if there is a large group staying for a number of nights. There's taxis always outside the hotel although flag down a blue band one on the road for a cheaper price. The shop inside the hotel is reasonably priced and the shisha is lovely. Would definitely come here again."

        "review_text": "I recently stayed at the Royal Victoria attracted by its fascinating history, its prime location next to the Medina and references to illustrious figures like Churchill or Puccini. The staff is definitely very friendly and helpful, which I sincerely appreciate.  However, I cannot fail to express my disappointment at the overall cleanliness of the hotel. There is visible dust on many surfaces, and the carpets at the entrance are badly damaged, with obvious stains that have been there for some time. This general neglect conveys a sense of abandonment that contrasts painfully with the quality that the building deserves.  And already the cube was finding a cockroach between that made us flee the room.   It is sad to see a place with so much potential and heritage value being dropped in this way. An improvement in cleaning and basic maintenance would be enough to restore some of the dignity that still exists in its architecture and courtesy of its staff."

        "review_text": "The hotel is in a historic building that once housed the British Consulate. Excellent location, at the entrance of the medina and al-Bahr Gate (connecting the old and new city). Colorful interior, with soft lighting and tiles on the walls. Extremely courteous service and good breakfast. There is also the restaurant, in case you are tired in the evening after exploring beautiful Tunis. I really liked the small terrace of the room overlooking Victory Square and the relaxing and very hot shower."

        "review_text": "Charming hotel at the gates of the Medina of Tunis, built in the former headquarters of the British Embassy. The traditional designs and patterns made with Tunisian tiles, which remind us of the Bey Palace home to the Bardo Museum, the hand-painted doors, ceilings, corners and attic, suddenly transport us to another time, another reality, almost like in a Michael Curtiz film with Humphrey Bogart, chased by international spies or hunting for hidden treasures."

        "review_text": "Location is great.  Right next to the medina entrance. Only took about 15min from the airport (depending on traffic).  Cost me 15 The hotel is listed as 4stars but I'd says its closer to 1-2 star based on US/EUR standards. The amenities are pretty much the bare minimum.  You get a fridge though and glass cups.  I got two waters.  Not sure if that is standard or for my two nights.  (Didn't get replenished the second day) The room is quite small but the high ceilings make it seem larger.  There are only four lights in the room (bathroom, main, and two night stands).  One of the nightstand lights did not work.  During the day, there was good light from the windows.  The room was a little dark at night.  I had a view of a rooftop. The room is rather dingy.  I judge a hotel's cleanliness by whether not I'd feel comfortable walking around barefoot.  I used slippers (that I had from the flight)  The whole room had tile.  The bathroom floor was most dirty.  Visible dirt/water stains, etc  The floor on the rest of the room was better but not much.  There were two rugs on either side that look like they've never been washed before.  The bed was not very comfortable.  Two singles pushed together with no connector.  Not very firm (not much support).  Sheets seemed clean though.  One pillow and decorative pillow for each bed. There is a tiny table with a chair.  The water and cups were on top of the fridge.  There was a closet but no place to put your suitcase. The bathroom was very small, barely enough room to sit on the toilet.  The water faucet had no screen so water tend to spray all over the place.  The shower stall bottom actually looked pretty new and clean.  The water temperature and pressure was a little hard to control.  The door didn't want to stay completely closed so you had to be careful where you pointed the wand. There was a cold/hot temperature control in the room.  It turned on a fan but the temperature of the air never changed. Breakfast was actually pretty good.  Lots a variety including local things."

It is located near the entrance to the Medina, so easy to reach both on foot and if you have a car as you can park without difficulty in the neighboring streets. The hotel is a bit “fanè”. Stairs dimly lit, terrace covered with pigeon droppings. Wi-fi not working the day we stayed there. Breakfast average. Not in line with a 4-star European. Great potential if it were properly renovated."

The architecture is beautiful and the location is next to the Medina, close to the theater and a short car ride to the Bardo Museum. However the hotel is tired and run down. The pillows are horrible. The towels are worn and frayed. We booked the suite and the fridge didn’t work, the heat didn’t work, the water switched hot to cold during showers and at peak times there was almost no water pressure. The WiFi either worked perfectly or not at all. The staff was very nice and organized a good tour for us but seemed to forget to get our taxi for the airport. We asked for ice and they had none - that was a first! Worst was the cleanliness. The bathroom needs a good scrub and there was a cigarette butt on the bathroom floor the entire stay, so clearly the bathroom floor never gets cleaned. The hotel is inexpensive but I wish I had paid more for a better experience."

We were offered the upgrade to the Elizabeth suite, a beautiful very large room with sumptuous decor.  Nothing to say about that. The breakfast could be better, especially in the quality of certain products; beware for those with intolerances or allergies (my wife is celiac) because apart from eggs and fruit... it is difficult to understand even if yogurt has gluten or not.... Given the cost of one night, the value for money is definitely favorable."

Thanks for changing us. But it doesn't catch up with the rest: Hello / goodbye does not exist / if you have a drink, we do not give you change .. there is not enough deckchair at the pool ... (obviously we are not the type to go reserve our deckchairs good others yes). The so-called private beach has no deckchairs and it is a walking landfill.... We had just spent 10 days in another hotel where it was quite the opposite... honestly the difference was brutal. We had planned 5 days there, we preferred to lose money for our comfort and go to another hotel barely 500m (reception at the top by the way and quality equipment we will return there )  No idea where the 4 stars of this establishment come from but with the same budget you have much better and without misleading advertising;)  And obviously when we announced our departure, the person at the reception just said ok as if it was usual (we were absolutely not asked what was going on ) Anyway, run away."

    "description": "The Russelia also called Coral-Plant or Fountain-Plant is a member of the Scropphulariacea family. This plant has several branched out and quadrangular, more or less drooping and fairly intertwined, stalks. Its leaves are elongated and oval-shaped. It is an original plant, of an attractive green colour that looks fresh throughout the year. Russelia blossoms from spring to the end of the summer. Its flowers are clustered into a loose bunch at the end of long slender peduncles. They are small-sized and bear a tubular corolla. The plant thus seems to be covered with a galaxy of scarlet small bells. Why The Russelior ? From a wedding between the Rareness and Delicateness of a flower that grows in altitude, in Northern Tunisia The “Russelia”, and the Nobleness and Beauty of the most precious among metals: “Gold”. The “Russelior” is born.Read more",

The comfortable room and great location made my experience really enjoyable.  I would have gladly given 5 stars, but at check-out I found an error in the charge of 60 euros more. The amount was returned to me in local currency, without an exchange receipt, causing an inconvenience at the airport: it was not possible to convert the money into euros, as an official receipt is required for the exchange.  A small incident that, unfortunately, partially ruined an otherwise perfect stay. However, I recommend the structure, with the hope that more attention will be paid to these details."

The first room they gave us was dirty with a view of a vacant lot the cleaning is very badly done...the catering is the disaster everything is gross you pay water 2 euros a bottle and all drinks are paid. As for the hotel staff they are not friendly people. Marwa the daughter of the host tried to swindle us regarding the price of a taxi 60 euros to go to the airport...The women of the hammam are not honest attention they sell olive oil cut in rapeseed or sunflower oil and she sold 4 bottles at the price of 8 euros a bottle of the flight!!! Frankly this hotel is to be avoided absolutely they are crooks!!! MeS vacation was ruined. I paid excessively for it!!!"

Little mention for the Spa where we had booked a 4-day cure. We were extremely well received by the hostess. The care has been at the top and the people who practice it at little care for us. This is a place that allowed us to make this vacation magical. Thanks to them  Stephanie and hervé"

On the second day i finally gave up and went off to the restaurant to get a coffee.... empty restaurant and they took upwards of 15 mins to make me two black coffees!!!!  Four seasons!!!!"

The hotel really has no charm: it looks nice enough when you enter, but it quickly starts to feel like a massive labyrinth, and the rooms (at least my one - 2124) are dreadfully stale.   2. It's massive and the layout is stupidly confusing, it actually takes forever to get to your room (plus when it's rainy the courtyard areas get slippery too, making it even more annoying)  3. The location is really not great. There is nowhere to have a nice walk around the hotel, it's isolated away from anything else, so you need to get a driver and head elsewhere to see anything interesting.  4. I found the food really disappointing.   5. There seem to be way more charming / boutique type options in far more atmospheric places, for example in Sidi Bou Said. That's definitely would I'd go for on my next visit to Tunis!"

        "review_text": "We stay at Four Seasons Hotels all over the world when we travel - we just adore them! On this occasion we were staying in a nearby apartment so satisfied ourselves with a couple of visits as non residents during our stay in Tunis.  We booked in for the Christmas Eve set course dinner in Creek, which was truly one of the most exceptional and beautifully presented meals we have experienced, huge compliments to the chef and the delightful staff.  However, we were horrified and shocked to see (or smell) that smoking is allowed inside the hotel in the lounge and bar area that is situated directly adjacent (no wall in between) to the restaurant and that we had to walk through this area to access the restaurant and to go to the toilet during our meal.  We could also smell the smoke at our table.  We could not believe that a hotel group of this standard could allow smoking in a public area that cannot be avoided!    Also the lady at the next table was smoking what looked like a vape - billows of smoke everywhere!  Apparantly Iqos are allowed to be smoked everywhere inside so we had no protection.  We could not believe that we were in a Four Seasons hotel as we have never experienced this!  I believe smoking is popular amongst Tunisians, but a hotel of this standard, catering to international guests, should not allow smoking indoors.  If it has to it should be in a completely enclosed area as in some airports.   Other hotels we stayed at during our Tunisian holiday in Hammamet and Sousse were totally non smoking indoors and one we stayed at even had a non smoking area in their outdoor restaurant. I would dread to be sitting outside at the Four Seasons Tunis, in the compact area around the pool and be subjected to smoke, it would totally ruin our experience - we do have to breathe they don't have to smoke!    Clearly non smokers are second class guests at the Four Seasons Tunis so non smokers be aware!"

A week before departure, we were informed that our reservation was cancelled due to work in the hotel. We were relocated to another establishment that had nothing to do with the standing of the Iberostar Selection Eolia Djerba, which did not correspond to our expectations or our travel habits.  It is impossible for us to postpone our holidays at the last minute, nor to find an equivalent stay. We therefore preferred to cancel everything, deeply disappointed.  This is the first time that this situation has happened to us. The work is not decided a week in advance: the hotel or its partners should have warned us much earlier, out of respect for their customers.  This lack of anticipation and consideration means that we will never book this hotel again, despite its beautiful appearance on paper"

Most receptionists were very helpful and friendly! Actually, they should all be! Most people in the ministry were okay, but really not everyone, unfortunately! Someone who jumped out for me in a positive way and ran his legs under his body was the waiter at the pool and the beach, Abdellsalam! Many compliments to him, because he worked extremely hard and tried to please everyone! Also the gentleman, I do not know his name unfortunately, from the teahouse was a sweet and pleasant man! If I ever want to go back to Djerba, I would choose this hotel again!"

The lady who cleaned my room Sassia did a great job, room lovely and clean every day.  There was a great choice of food and drink, and the restuarant staff were great as always, espicially James.  I would like to thank the guys who served you round the pool, they were always very busy but got on with it with a smile even in the very hot temperatures. A special thanks to Maher who really looked after me and also a thank you to Wissam. Ben in the main bar also done a great job. Unfortunately i can not remember everyones name, sorry.  The animation team done a great job, very busy every day, unfortunately i can only remember one name and that was leo.  I cant wait to go back and have a great time again.  So i would like to thank all the staff again from the Management to all the other employees who all did a great job."

This has been my 3rd visit now and honestly can say I have never found fault but certainly this time around it feels the service has gone up a notch. There are staff and managers everywhere!! Always checking if everything is OK. If you need or have a problem it's sorted within minutes which is very rare in this day and age. The rooms are spacious and definitely recommend a sea view room. No hidden extra costs either as safe, bathrobes, slippers, beach towels, sunbeds on the beach are all free!! Rooms are cleaned daily to a high standard. Great choice of food and drinks also. Daily activities and entertainment is very good and definitely worth a watch!! All the staff work extremely hard and make the whole holiday enjoyable. Spoke to many single female travellers which just shows how safe they feel. Highly recommend this great hotel. Many thanks xx"

        "review_text": "We have recently stayed at the Marhaba Palace Hotel. Well we are leaving today, pity.  The rooms are great and cleaned daily only fault is for tea and coffee facilities, they leave an assortment of tea bags, 2 sachets of coffee and sugar. No milk, strange. Bottles of water are left daily.  The hotel it's self, might have been a 5 star in the beginning now it is low 4 high 3. Needs some work to bring to a higher class.   The food is great, there is something to eat for everyone. Just remember it isn't English food. You want English food, stay in the UK or go to Spain. There are plenty of choices. The restaurant staff are fantastic and friendly. Can the cats be kept out of the main restaurant. Not everyone likes cats rubbing their bodies against you while dining.  Bars. The drink is plenty full, local spirits and beers. A small cocktail list though pre-mixed. Staff again are very friendly and attentive.  Pool, plenty of sun beds, why do people go down at 06:00 put towels down then not go back for hours. The pool bar could do with an update, currently half is in use. Weather they increase it in the summer, not sure.   Animation team. Good entertainment,they don't go bugging you while eating or sun bathing. Yes they come past and ask, say no. They leave you alone. No pressuring to join in, no nagging to buy bingo cards. They do their best to keep you entertained. The usual water aerobics and games.   Over all a very enjoyable holiday."

        "review_text": "Lovely pool areas, plenty of sun bed & parasols. Rooms are dated, we had to try 3 rooms as issues with all of them, black out blinds don't close, shower tray leaked, safe & television didn't work. Air conditioning was working either, we ended up leaving the patio doors open. you can hear people  in the their rooms too, especially when they are moving chairs for some reason. Daily  room cleaners don't do great job, forgot to leave towels & water, empty bins, basic stuff which you would expect to be done. Staff are amazing especially in the restaurant, you get to sit at the same table most of the time, just to note that you have to choose if you want 1st sitting for dinner @ 6.30 pm or wait until 7.45 pm for 2nd sitting.  Food does get a bit repetitive & cold. If like salad & pasta you will be fine, French fries & bread plentiful. There is a guy who does fresh orange juice @ breakfast but be prepared to queue. Themed nights, not all food labelled so you don't know what you are eating until you try it & there is a lot of waste then, plenty of sweet treats & fresh fruit. Staff also in the bar areas are polite, friendly they get to know your drinks order. Good beach location & again plenty of beds, restaurant/bar there also so easy for drinks & late breakfast & lunch if you didn't want to go to main restaurant.  All communal areas are exceptional clean, including the toilets( be aware that you can't flush toilet paper down any of the toilets, put in the bins provided)  You can walk into the harbour area less than 10 minutes but be prepared to be pestered by the bar staff,  sales teams trying to sell you trips, to be honest wasn't worth the walk, the area very run down & full of rubbish!  Animation team work hard around the pool area all day getting you involved with games etc. Live music in the bar area, pianist was amazing & saxophonist  wasn't bad either, but again gets really busy in there, they had to take the tables & chairs from outside to accommodate people & this is not main season.  Wouldn't class this as a 5* maybe 3.5 at best, wouldn't recommend & wouldn't go back."

Several swimming pools a little cool but nice because you always find room! The meals are varied and good. The activities are great thanks to the animators of the mini club Mouna, Touta, Estefania and Maelys who make the holidays of the little ones magical and set the mood with their mini disco. At the spa you can do beauty treatments with Loubna she is great and also braid with Zeineb who is adorable and very gifted thanks again for my 2 daughters <3"

We stayed in rooms 110 and 111. Neither room had a proper working safe- this was a disaster trying to get sorted. The water didn’t drain from the shower in 111 either. Then we move onto the big problem!! We all got bitten while there- we thought it was mosquitos as there is definitely a problem with them around the Resort. Came home to discover that it’s actually bed bugs!! Fantastic!!   On checking out no room was available for us to keep on so we had to use the shower room to get changed.. I’ve seen better on “worlds worst jails” they are stinking of urine, the water is freezing and they have cctv cameras in them!   The food is questionable.. breakfast being the only decent meal. Then when you go to leave the hotel the taxi drivers try to rip you off! I’ve been to Tunisia many times and if this would have been my first time I would never return.   The hotel needs to up its game regarding food and pest control. Never ever again!!"

Entertainment team were very good.  Foam party in the pool was amazing.  Food was OK, could be better.  Everywhere was clean all the time.  Would we go back, YES, my grandchildren were crying on the way back to the airport as they didn't want to leave, they had a fantastic holiday.

They put 100% effort into everything from 9am to 11pm with a smile on their faces  Big love to the whole team ❤️  The hotel overall is really clean and rooms are cleaned daily with towels washed and beds made.   The food is nice. I’m vegetarian so struggled a bit as not everything is labelled that clearly, but there is plenty to eat and they have themed nights throughout the week.  The beach bar is open for food and drinks 24 hours a day.   Tips really go a long way! Tip your waiter and they will save you a table and have your drinks ready, tip your maid and you get freshly picked flowers on your bed etc  Overall, the staff are lovely, so welcoming and there is always something to do/see.   100% recommend this hotel if you want to visit Tunisia 🇹🇳"

Room was basic, the air con was useless. No plugs beside the bed. Only 2 plugs by the dressing table. Shower kept going hot then cold. Tip: take some extra hangers. Bed nice & comfy.  Beach bar wasn't serving any snacks or food until high season apparently. Only served wine, beer & soft drinks.  Pool area kept tidy. Sammi the pool attendant/lifeguard was an absolute star. Waiters are always on hand to get you drinks from the bar, especially Eshem & Falid. They went above & beyond.  Food in the restaurant was a bit samey but ok. Plenty to choose from though.  Snacks were served in the a la carte restaurant but looked like all leftovers from breakfast, lunch & dinner (bit disappointed)  The entertainment team was always around trying to get you involved in various activities.  All the Staff we encountered was very friendly throughout the hotel.  Tip: if you get a taxi into Sousse Medina, make sure you turn your wristband inside out before you get there. There are scammers that  say they work in the hotel & it's their day off, and they offer to take you round various government backed authentic shops. It's a rip off. Please do not be fooled."

The restaurant was ok but the dishes a little repetitive with a limited choice on the other hand during the Tunisian evening the dishes were succulent. The undeniable strength of this hotel and undoubtedly the entertainment team that made our holiday just exceptional, my children loved the kid's club a big thank you to Pika and Gigi.

        "review_text": "Stayed as a couple a week ago. Hotel doesn’t look as flashy from the outside compared to others, when you pull up but the warmth of the staff and amenities make up for that. We stayed in the main royal building and had a distant seaview which was lovely and the room was spotless. Maids always cleaning everywhere in the hotel! The only issue is there’s only one plug socket in the room and the air con doesn’t come on til june (a Gov rule), which was hard as it was 38 degrees when there, so sleeping was hard. Quite noisy if neighbours are stomping about upstairs as no soundproofing. A nice walk in shower and quick lifts. Staff were lovely and we felt if you tip them (just a small amount to us)  you’ll get better service, so worth doing. We did a walkabout video on YouTube (badcrumblexxx) which may help you. We felt the hotel was lower budget when there but having looked at hotels since, it’s actually not. The food was really lovely for all meals with a good selection. I wish I’d used the gym (best I’ve seen in a hotel) as I put on lots of weight! Animation team worked very hard. We stayed by the small pool as it was quiet. The slide pool is salt water which wasn’t so good. Only thing is perhaps not so good for disabled people, no lift to lower pool or dining room. It’s a large complex so quite a bit of walking one end to the other. The spin class music was deafening which was annoying but only happens every so often and lots of smokers in the public areas which wasn’t so nice if you don’t smoke.  We had a fab stay and would def stay again but only when the air con was on! Special thanks to Said, Lotfi, Aziz and Alexander. All of who looked after us beautifully."

        "review_text": "This hotel as goods and bad points firstly we will go for the good the hotel is lovely all public areas are cleaned constantly and room was cleaned everyday fresh towels everyday the hotel is huge the kids pool was amazing and most importantly the staff are friendly nothing is too much trouble and fablous with the kids once you find your bearings around the hotel and it's sister hotel it's easy to get sround it's like it's only little village with all its little walk ways the down side for us and it  let down the most was the food it did have some positive like fresh made pasta that kids lived off and fresh pizza. The breakfast lacked options simple things like mushrooms and hash brown there wasn't lot of fresh fruit options and lunch and tea there wasn't lot of choice either lots of liver the theme nights had the best options also the beach bar there was lots of flies and really hard to find a seat. Also tye kids club could of been advertised more they didn't really come around asking if the kids wanted to go and what's was happening each day the animation team was lovely but felt it was more towards the adults games instead of both adults and kids. We would maybe go back again if the good options improved."

There were plenty of sunbeds always available, just ask the lifeguards and they will get one for you,  thank you to Ahmed.  The bar and restaurant staff were brilliant,  special thank you to Hamsa and Mohammed.  It is obvious who the leaders of the animation team were, but the other guys were the friendliest,  Momo, Foden, Sam, Chadou,  Bibo, Ziko and Patricia.  The food was plentiful and tasty, always such a selection and very fresh. Spoke to the guys at the fitness suite,  but declined to take part in a spin class, but Younes was very polite, knowledgeable and helpful. I am definitely hoping to come back,  thank you all again.  🙏"

        "review_text": "As in every stay in the hotels of the Marhaba chain, I was never disappointed. What makes this property particularly interesting is its structure: several resorts, each with its own pool and bar. In total, there are three outdoor swimming pools, an indoor pool, three or four bars, as well as two restaurants, one of which is by the sea.  The room was spotless, very clean, with stunning sea views, everything is functional and quality. The drinks included in the all inclusive formula are excellent, and the food is tasty. The staff is friendly and always smiling. A special mention to Hamza of the bar service, which does a remarkable job at the pool – thanks to him!  I will definitely return to this hotel which really impressed me."

There is plenty of wardrobe space  and a nice tv but only news channels in English but that’s ok you do not get a information book in your room so you have to ask where things are in the hotel We found the food plentiful and tasty and the waiter’s are very good and friendly and the local drinks are nice the entertainment doesn’t start till about 9 pm in the evening there’s two places that have evening entertainment  We used to walk into Sousse and we got the train a couple of times once to El Jem and once to monastir which Dacia lot of money if you do get a taxi don’t get from the guys by the hotel get them on the street and ask the price  I think the hotel is good value for money and would go there again it just needs more information and to start the entertainment earlier"

        "review_text": "The El Mouradi El Menzah hotel is located in an exceptional location (facing the sea, in Yasmine Hammamet) but clearly suffers from a lack of maintenance and quality management. If you are looking for a quiet, clean and well organized stay, this is probably not the right choice. If you are flexible, the sea view and the beach are your priorities, and you accept very limited comfort, then this may be possible... on a low budget. Personally, I would not recommend it unless you get a very cheap offer and your expectations are really minimal. The \"sea view\" experience should not compensate for problems of hygiene, food or comfort. Good luck 💖💖"

        "review_text": "I don’t even know where to begin, on arrival was placed in a different hotel due to it being closed. Hotel room is mediocre at best. DONT get all inclusive there’s barely anything offered to drink and it’s all bottles poured into tiny drinking cups. All drinks are luke warm it’s terrible.  No wifi unless sat in the lobby of the opposite hotel.  Only one pool is allowed to be used- the slides seen in pictures are barricaded off and not allowed to be used. The hotel in the picture is not used for anything but sleeping they send you to another hotel to do everything else.  Hardly any communication if your English- if your french it’s a little better but hardly. Nothing to do all day sat by the pool.  Let’s get into the food/breakfast/dinner experience-  It’s like a swarm of wasps attacking something- I’ve never seen anything like it everyone is fighting for food pushing snatching food not even using the tongs provided- non of the food is labeled you have to guess what they are.  The food is not catered for British or European people- not that we was bothered but some meals we missed completely.  Along with the lack there of communication- finding where to go to get food or the toilets is a game of survival of the fittest. In the dining hall there are limited number of seats and they prioritise people with different wristbands and will tell you NO if you try to sit down but then if you try to leave with your food to eat elsewhere they will follow you shouting.  If you ask questions or ask for something IE cutlery or cups they simply look at you in disgust and walk away.  We booked to stay for one week and have never been so unhappy with the service and the hotels hospitality.  If you ask me the hotel is in need of proper management and hospitality training.   Waste of my money and time"

Arrived late in Saturday night was allocated a room, no key, had to keep going to the desk and wait for someone to let us in. Room was very dirty. Was told a key would be available to us after breakfast... we had to wipe everything down before unpacking... went down on Sunday for breakfast... forget anything English. The food wasn't catered at all for British people.. couldn't even had a croissant as no butter, jams, cheeses or hams. Couldn't get drunk as the spirits in the all inclusive were watered down. The furniture in the room was battered and rotten. The balcony paint was flaking. Our safe wasn't working do was told a replacement was being sorted.. this didnt materialise. The beds are like sleeping on the floor and the pillows are like sandbags, I woke up aching every morning. The 2 good things about this hotel are the pool and the hospitality staff. The bathroom flooded everytime we had a shower as the shower curtain was letting the water through. Be aware when walking about as you will get hassled all the time to go in the shops. Cigarette but outside the lift for 3 days.. Avoid avoid avoid."

We noticed how dated the furniture was and how threadbare and dirty the carpets were. The balcony banister was rotting and unsafe to lean on. The bathroom bath had rust stains and the coating on the base of the bath had rotted away! Tiling must have been done by a chimpanzee! We complained and was given keys to check another room. This had a carpet that had a large section out and stuck back down. The carpet was absolutely filthy! Human hair balls matted into carpet! The third room we were offerd was habitable although the hairdryer was broken and there was only one plug socket to charge items! The hotel is massive with lots of pools and spa center. But needs A LOT OF MONEY spent to bring it up to 4 star! The maintenance staff need sacking as signs of shoddy workmanship everywhere! There seems to be lots of managers loafing around but no one correcting the faults within the hotel! Location is excellent, right next to beach. Could be an amazing hotel if money and proper management were spent on it!"

If you are stupid enough to ignore my comments and still book a trip to Tunisia please arrange your preferred tours from home before you travel. Also carry enough money to eat from out, unless off you love oranges. Those reading after booking good luck."

Says it’s a 4* hotel but in reality more like 1*.   Rooms are awful, beds rock hard and pillows are lumpy and full of stains.   The all inclusive food on offer is quite simply vile. No options for children. We have eaten out everyday which defeats the purpose of booking an all inclusive. The dining hall is rotten. We was violently sick 3 days out of 5.   We couldn’t wait to leave and fly home. I would never visit Tunisia again. Love Holidays should take this hotel off their option list."

        "review_text": "I hope you are seated with a cup of your favourite beverage to hand...  First time writing a review for a hotel stay. El Mouradi El Menzah  No safe in room so had to carry all valuables with us all times  Hair on floors and bathroom sink Broken shower handle so the head did not stay in place  Key stopped turning on second day No telephone in room to call reception so every problem required a trip downstairs and back  Telephones are for show and connect to nothing!  Shower gel not replaced so had to keep asking daily  Poor wifi in lobby and none in rooms Second floor call button in lift stopped working on second day  Very old and dated decor which needs serious renovation. The next door hotel looked much better.  Food was bland or unusual tasting. Few options for children. Not much variety and there was always a long queue for anything you wanted. They need more food stations and service staff.  Second day a very large group of youngsters from a football academy came for their stay. Oh boy! Dinner was like pigs rushing for the trough. The restaurant didn't use both sides of buffet to speed things up. Plates ran out and one man almost fought the restaurant manager on duty over it. Tables were short and guests were nicking chairs from other tables, at one point some guests were eating standing up! Guests had to clear their own tables because the servers were so overwhelmed. There was no consideration of the extra 100+ generally-always-teenage boys that would be coming to dinner. One of them got so cross with a granny trying to cut in that it looked like he might shove her to the back of the line! Chaos is not the word but I do not what is.   Same plate shortage happened on day. Abismal"

In terms of catering no fake sugar saccharin for people who have to monitor sugar it is a problem nor any substitute for cow's milk, no vegetal milk! No jarred yogurt in the morning or fresh fruit in the morning and rarely at meal!!! Microwave its broken turntable does not work and new tea machine that offered succulent broken tea after 2 days!!!  Animation non-existent except the morning muscle building gym very birn and very professional but terrible aquagym with unbearable techno music  And the whole day of mystical techno or arabic has bottomed sui fzit lal at the head of everyone but to the unlikely taste of the young ka sono who does not care royally about the opinions and requests of customers   And finally clientele mostly pru educated, not polite, who insults the staff, respects nothing and bathes in burkini despite the ban   Brief hotel very mediocre, poorly soundproofed, very noisy, no wifi or French channels  A LOT OF THINGS TO IMPROVE IF THEY WANT NOT TO CLOSE"

Bottom line - very underwhelming compared to my previous experiences at similar price points (albeit the comparison is to mexico and turkey)  Things I liked:  Inexpensive overall Nice staff  Enjoyed the food  Lovely beach  Nice pools  Clean   Things I didn't like:  We arrived at night after the restaurant had closed. They gave us a plate of cold food (salad, cured meats, a boiled egg). Underwhelming and not what we are used to at other all inclusives.  No entertainment  Lack of atmosphere at the hotel  Lights would be switched off at around 11pm despite people being sat in the lobby.  Running out of drinks  Not having beach towels (even early in the day e.g. midday)  Menus / brochures only being in French  AC not being on half the year regardless of temperature  Being charged extra for the gym (seriously?? I've never seen this before at a 5* all inclusive)"

Nice touch. Porter took our cases to our room. We had booked a beach bungalow. It’s basically a lovely room, with a terrace and direct access onto the beach. Away from the main part of the hotel. So tranquil, beautiful views of the sea. Robes and slippers provided, tea and coffee facilities, small fridge with fresh water everyday. The beach is beautiful, great bar, look out for Kareem the bar man. So lovely and helpful. The beach is so relaxing. The restaurant is amazing, something for everyone! Oysters! Wow. Our waiter, Lefty, looked after us like Kings and Queens.  I only have 1 fault with the place, no Prosecco! What’s that about lol. Pushed me out of my comfort zone, gin and mojitos are my new faves😍 Tunisia is a beautiful country with beautiful people.  This hotel is amazing and we will be sad to leave ❤️   of the hotel. Huge, comfy bed and bath!"

        "review_text": "This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at. After an almost 4 hour flight delay, we arrived to be greeted by the hotel staff and quickly escorted to the lunch area, which closed in 30 minutes of our arrival - very thoughtful as  they anticipated our fatigue and hunger after an almost 11 hour travel time from home to the hotel. The food throughout our stay was '5-star': sushi, oysters, vegetarians, meat-eaters or fish-lovers - all our catered for, as was our sweet-tooth - their desserts and patisserie area could respectfully rival any in France. Equally, the A La Carte Italian seafood restaurant experience was one of the many food highlights of our trip. Our room was spacious and peaceful, with air-con and a lovely balcony with an ocean view, that also overlooked the 3- pools, including an infinity pool. Our room was cleaned daily and the hotel was spotless and had a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant staff were also kind and thoughtful. The indoor pool and Thalassa was used by us. The entertainment was low-key and 'chilled' (singers, musicians and dancers); however, the bonus of having access to the sister hotel, next door, meant that we could see 'shows' and access a disco and a range of day entertainment for adults and children for free. Absolute excellent value for money. Thank you Zainab, Chokra  and the whole team."

We opted for a standard room, which was spacious, well maintained, with a king size bed and partial sea views, but one small note: the air conditioning was not turned on, although it was a little hot (26-28°C) for a month of May. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful, especially the chefs, who are very responsive. The buffet offers a nice variety, although the pastry section could be improved. The pools are superb, as are the sea views, and the burkini is allowed for veiled women, which is a plus. I recommend this hotel without any hesitation. I share with you some pictures"

They also have Azur gallery with spectacular pieces of art.   Reception staff and guest relationship manager are very professional, knowledgeable and helpful. They are always there to help.  Waiters are doing exceptionally good job in all 3 restaurants on site. Variety of food in the main restaurant is simply amazing - there was something to suit all tastes, no matter where in the world you came from - pizza, pasta, grilled fish, beef goulash, salad, etc and lots of fresh bakery, also plenty of fruit and desserts.   There are also several pools, spa center, indoors and outdoors chill lounges. Very conveniently in the hotel area (10 metres away from hotel entrance) there is Le Grandes Bazaar - local shop where you can buy souvenirs, clothing, carpets, cosmetic and other stuff surprisingly at a very decent price.   Simply the best hotel in Hammamet.   Thank you!"

We quickly became ill and yet we avoided ice cubes. Leave with smecta and probiotics.  The pool staff, whether lifeguards or bartenders, do not necessarily bother to greet us and are unpleasant.  The staff at the front desk is very kind as well as the maids.  We are satisfied with our room except the soundproofing, we heard the noises from outside and the lobby until 1:30 in the morning this night.  We had sent an email to find out if there was a gym, a positive response from the hotel but on site we were surprised to discover that you had to pay 50dinars a day to access it.  The pictures of the hot tub attractive on the ad but it is only accessible by taking an additional option that is not indicated on the site."

The entire outdoor area is beautiful and relaxing. Beach is just a little walk down or you can use the lift. Light entertainment during the nights, nothing too much. If you want to book excursions, you can book through the main office. Big thank you to ZAINAB and HANA at the reception. They were so lovely all throughout our stay.

Relaxing entertainment at night -saxophonist was great. Downside … too much use of plastic bottles and straws. Can the straws be replaced with card ones? Can plastic  bottles of water in the rooms be replaced with refillable glass ones? Can the shampoo, shower gel plastic bottles be replaced with all in one solid bars?. The only snacks available outside of mealtimes were small wrapped sandwiches from an outside bar. This is ok for me but at other “all inclusive resorts” snack options have been more widely available"

What seperates this hotel to others is the view, the best in Hammamet I was informed by our waiter around the pool Skander. what a lovely young man, nothing was any trouble and he was insulted if I went to the bar as he wanted to serve us poolside. The drinks are all served in glasses which is a nice touch, rather than plastic cups which other all inclusive hotels have normally presented us with. The pool area - impeccable, so well designed, you do not feel on top of anyone and lots of shaded areas if required. Lots of beds, very comfortable beds but in the morning these can be very wet as they are hosed down every morning, these do dry out quite quick though. Now the food - fantastic buffet restaurant with lots of choice, all fresh and something for everyone, we always straight to the grill section with fresh fish, meat etc. The pizzas were also very good. All in all amazing people, lovely hotel and an amazing holiday,  Thank you to all the staff at Royal Azur!!"

The spacious bathroom. It is however poorly arranged, the towel hooks of the sinks force to skin the back of the hands!  The 2 TVs work simultaneously... The terrace in front of the rooms sends back the heat and the air conditioning is not functional until May! An oven! The restaurant is nothing exceptional except the morning Tunisian honey cakes: excellent! As for the waiters, both restaurants and bars, it would be nice to reform them to the reception of all customers. The beach is nice and the sea a translucent blue-green. For me, a 5-star rating, even by local standards, should anticipate the needs of customers."

Thanks also to Simba for coming to lunch and dinner with me on several occasions. I must also say that the chief animators is in my opinion very clever and false!!!! 3rd stay in 2 years and I would definitely return. Bravo to all And also a thank you to Ali for his kindness to the small business of the hotel  The Princess of the Mr. Reception sincerely thanks her Thank you again. SYLVIE"

The masseuse who sleeps on you and who dares to ask you if you liked it, it’s making fun of people’s heads, the exorbitant prices for everything, we are considered cash cows, we can do nothing, knowing that the average salary is 350 euros per month there, the restaurant a lot of smoke, smell of snuff and many people have been sick, vomiting temperature diarrhea flatulence, the animators only a few are very invested if not the others it’s the hunt for the young beautiful and easy where very old but rich to leave the country, alcohol sex disco chew money, there are many problems in this hotel, nothing serious early on.

The hotel has 3 swimming pools, 1 of which is covered.  All-day activities are planned by facilitators who are not insistent. Quality evenings with superb shows  Music a little loud indoors.   The buffet is varied and of very good quality from morning to night.  The all inclusive is respected.  The room is clean and enough for a stay. However if your stay falls or the air conditioning is not activated in the room good courage, because even if there is strong heat June is June!   If you are looking for small activities watch out for the scammer  I would not recommend the shop inside the hotel at all.  But if you are looking for a place to be pampered at resonable prices compare to the hotel, walk 10min on the beach and you will find a hotel with a spa “at momo” you will not be disappointed.   I recommend and will be back."

Unforgettable atmosphere thanks to a team of young animators full of energy. Smiling, attentive, they invite you to participate or let you rest.👍 The shows (dance and music) are worthy of professionals.  The beach a few meters away allows you to enjoy the turquoise waters or the pool and its entertainment, move or relax (2nd swimming pool quiet). Each hotel staff is present to bring you all the well-being of a successful week’s holiday. Whether it is the reception, the rooms, the restaurant, the bar, all welcome you with a smile. Looking forward to returning"

We spent every day at the large pool area where Taemar organised our sunning spot every morning and the bar staff looked after us all day 🍻🍷☕💯.  The Restaurant Staff were just amazing and the food was good and plentiful.  Our last night was pretty special as our table had been decorated with silk runner and rose 🌹 petals.

Food is excellent, and the restaurant staff and chefs are second to none. The bars are always attended so you can always get your drinks, they even go and bring them to you. Now the entertainment, there are 3 of them, Massimo who is in charge then Momoo, and not forgetting the lovely Rania all three of them start really early and finish late and in that time they offer a full programme they include everyone, you can do as much as you like or as little, but you will always see them around smiling. The pool areas are immaculate and staffed by at least 2 lifeguards so little ones can feel safe, pools are 1.5 metres, there is a heated indoor pool sauna steam room and a intensive package should you require massages of all types. The hotel is very secure with 24hour security always present and you can always feel safe. I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this hotel to anyone as you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to return early in June of this year to see all my friends we made whilst in the hotel. 5* in all departments  Our room was 402"

Stains on the carpet that brings to the room for evidence nice coffee stayed 2 days on the floor. Sock that must wait desperately to find the way back to the garbage on the ledge of our balcony (stayed the 10 days we were present). Let’s not talk about the car alarms that ring every night as well as the hoods of the kitchens that start at 6:30 am just like the diskettes of the works. No one from the smiling reception when you arrive but then after you don't have to ask. Fortunately the waiters gave us a smile and why we were on holiday tt particularly Osama of extreme kindness.

        "review_text": "Customer service at Golden Tulip President Hammamet and customer care was sadly lacking  unfortunately. Everyone remembers how you treat them and the women staff at the reception, for example Wiem was so so un helpful for simple enquiry, there was almost a fear to actually go to the receptionist for help or support because of thier disinterest in actually helping. They continue conversation with local language speakers and avoided eye contacted each time you approached them. For simple requests, we booked a family room with a sea view.but was put in a bungalow far away from the hotel, with stairs with a baby/ a push chair, each time It rained It was sliperey, so imagine having to carry that up and down the stairs. This room also had no WiFi access, Eventually after asking again and again and again, we got moved, to a different room, although this was not the sea view room we paid for. The experience at this hotel was just unfortunate as we've previously had a great experience with other staff at a different hotel in Tunisia. Some of the staff in the kitchen were helpful. The food was okay, however, management/leadership at the hotel would benefit from ups killing their staff on customers care and better service."

        "review_text": "Hotels is lovely as are its staff especially the night time bar staff in the indoor bar (I did have their names on a piece of paper at my request however this has now been through the wash 😟) our room was beautiful and specious with a lovely view, we were all inclusive so min bar topped up daily in the room. We would have struggled if we were half board like a lot of the guests as there isn’t anything near the hotel. On check in our room wasn’t ready but the guy handling our check in was polite and friendly and we were able to access all of the facilities whilst we waited. Pool and garden areas were clean and well maintained, the pool bar opened whilst we were there which made getting drinks in the day time easier as prior to this we had to get dressed and walk to the inside bar (a minor inconvenience) The beach for the hotel is lovely however the beach bar was not open during our stay) the food was fresh and lovely and the staff were happy to make things fresh. The spa is definitely worth a visit and not expensive if you book a package as these work out much cheeper. We had a hammam, soap scrub the lady which did this was fantastic she sang and chatted to us throughout and was so lovely, we then had massages it cost less the £80 for the 2 of us.This is out of the control of the hotel but the surrounding area is scruffy,  the beaches were disgusting, full of litter and on our walk to the new town we passed a dead turtle which had clearly been there a while 😖 our visit to the old town wasn’t much better and I would only recommend this if you liked to be hassled and dragged around by people constantly. We visit lots of Arabic countries and have been to Tunisia historically but we felt unsafe and uneasy leaving our hotel so wouldn’t recommend. The hotel is perfect for a relaxing, don’t leave the hotel all inclusive week"

There is a shop on site to cater for all your needs and for anyone wanting a spot of pampering there is a beauty salon as well as Turkish baths. I used the gym several times and did classes with the fitness instructor at the hotel. Special thanks to Daly, who was very professional and gave me some excellent advice on exercises to do at home.

        "review_text": "We had not visited Tunisia before and were not sure what to expect.  We loved our stay more on each of the 10 days we have been here.  So much so that this is the 1st holiday we have ever been on that we plan to rebook again (for a similar time next year) as soon as we get home!!   The hotel, our room (pool and sea view) and the grounds were all beautiful and very clean.   All the staff are super friendly and efficient. A very high standard of customer service from everyone who works here. The room was exactly like the pictures, on the booking site...very clean and spacious and the bed & pillows were very comfortable. The hotel location is great! Right on a beautiful beach, in a peaceful location.  Jasmine Hammemet is walkable, or a short and cheap taxi away.  Old town Hammemey was not walkable but the taxi fare is still only around £3 to £4 each way.  There were lots of people we met that were returning.  One couple were back for a 33rd visit!  I almost didn't want to leave a review in case it ruins our next experience because of becoming too popular!! Overall a holiday that exceeded our expectations and I can see us visiting many more times in the future. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for a wonderful holiday x"

        "review_text": "Second time at Oceana, we loved it as much as the first. The hotel is always clean, the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the grounds are immaculate. We prefer to visit out of season for the quiet but obviously don't get to experience everything on offer as it's pre-season.  Only minor issue we had was a large conference event shortly after arrival. This is quite off-putting for guests as the conference attendees take over the restaurant and consume everything. Another guest has addressed this, so I'm not going to go over old ground.   There is also a guy in the hotel, I won't name him as he is there legitimately, but he hangs about the toilets, trying to organise  trips into Hammamet, amongst other things. Strikes me a snake oil salesman, but if I want something, I'll ask. I don't want to feel like I need to find alternative toilets to avoid him.  Every single member of the Oceana team go above and beyond, and they will always find a way to assist, even if you don't understand each other. They will find a way. Special nod to Bashir in the restaurant, the morning chef (sorry, I didn't get your name), Ramy at poolside, and Fatima in housekeeping. So many more who's names I didn't catch.  Can't wait to go back again."

April is pre season and pretty quiet but enjoyed that even though we went during Easter school holiday. Beach bar etc not open due to low occupancy but bar staff amazing  Indoor pool heated and lovely beach area with numerous sunbeds & umbrellas with attentive staff.  Would like to say that:- Touis (bar waiter) amazing so thoughtful and makes an amazing Pina Colada and was so friendly to my twins.  Daly (personal trainer) was great with the kids and went above and beyond to adjust his schedule to fulfil our needs.  Rami (poolboy) kept the pool in immaculate condition and was there with your towels and sunbed cushions as soon as you appeared near the pool.  Thank you for a great stay and holiday."

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff are truly outstanding — they go above and beyond. One evening, my daughter, who’s quite a picky eater, didn’t like anything at the buffet. The chef noticed, and without hesitation, went to the kitchen and made her some pasta just for her. That kind of service really stood out.  There are a few downsides. The hotel is showing some signs of wear, particularly in the carpets, bathrooms, and some of the seating in the restaurant, which could use updating. We stayed in a spacious suite with a sea view, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. However, the air-conditioning wasn’t on, which made it hard to sleep. I requested a fan, but it never arrived — disappointing, especially from a 5-star hotel at the price we paid.  One thing to note: the hotel hosts a lot of conferences, and this really should be mentioned during booking. Tourists were definitely in the minority during our stay. The conference groups completely took over the restaurant. Some were quite rude and acted with a sense of entitlement, showing little regard for paying guests — something that should be better managed by the hotel.  The food was okay, but perhaps not to our taste. We weren’t expecting sausage and peppers or boiled potatoes for breakfast, for example. Not a complaint, just an observation. There were no snacks available between meals, aside from a plate of crisps at the bar, which felt lacking for an all-inclusive package — especially considering the price.  We also visited the marina one evening, but unfortunately, it wasn’t a great experience. It felt run-down, with many shops closed and the area quite dirty — though perhaps it’s better in the summer months. Also, be prepared to be firm with the local street sellers.  All in all, a mixed experience: excellent staff and spacious rooms, but let down by a few avoidable issues that could really elevate the stay if addressed."

        "review_text": "Been back a week now, I have to say this was the most relaxing break I've had. The hotel occupancy was low, never more than 30 guests, which worried me at first as I thought I might get bored, but I soon got used to the tranquility and quiet. Staff were fantastic, especially Sameh on reception, who upgraded me to a sea view room at check in. There are no animation/entertainment team at the hotel, which was a first for me, had a couple of treatments at the spa which were inexpensive, good choice of food everyday and chilled evening entertainment.  Glad I paid that little bit extra for the all inclusive as I was drinking Jonnie Walker red label whisky every night, also included was Gordon's gin and other premium spirits. Had a relaxing week and would highly reccomend Oceana, I will be returning."

Drinks and food where at a very good quality, mainly Fish, Lamb & Chicken dishes, the red wine was severed by the glass , 1/2 or full bottle great deserts.  a walk to the Marina down from the private beach is do-able (20mins). would recommend this hotel especially if you just want to chill with the option the take the Taxi to the market in Hammamet ( 15 - 20 Dina). we also had the Spa treatment at the hotel which was excellent, Sonia I think was her name who sang and was very good with the start of our treatment. we also had a free Al-a-cart meal included in our stay which was really nice with a higher spec of meal & wine. CONS - exchanged money has restrictions so don't take any out of the country, defo eat before you get to the airport as the only place open was a baguette and burger place which was £12 for a burger and chips... a sandwich shop and shop selling bags before you go past passport control is the only place you can spend Dina."

        "review_text": "Following the recent opening of a direct flight from Moscow to Tunisia, we decided to revisit that country. Of the available hotels, Regency was interested in Monastir. Among the great advantages is its central position with the possibility to walk quietly through the port (Marina) even in the late evening.   Also in line of sight and the main attractions i.e. Ribat and the Bugriba Mausoleum. Very high quality and good food for breakfasts, lunches and dinners with strawberries and shrimp. A pleasant and colorful building of the hotel itself.  Animation by physical activity is qualitative and varied. True, there's no gym but it's not noticeable. Rooms are clean, quiet and well cleaned. There is a children's club and a small playground, but the girl in charge of them doesn't like to show up there and a search for her is necessary for its use.  It's a nice impression overall."

The waiters at the restaurant are super friendly also, the food is very good and varied. The rooms are quite old but clean, the bedding is perhaps to be reviewed. The location of the hotel is ideal because 5 minutes from the city center, I recommend Fram outings with the animators, it is very interesting. The pool bar is not open with regret. At the interior bar, space not reserved for hotel guests and I regret that the service is less neat for guests in all exclusive. Sometimes we walk past you four times without looking at you and we serve you cocktails that have nothing to do with what you asked for, it's a little sloppy. In terms of security I find it is borderline, the outdoor gates access beach are smashed, so everyone goes back access to the pool and the hotel. The more non-hotel guests at the bar, it's open bar, the more smoking in a part of the bar. Otherwise, I recommend treatments and massages at the spa, they are all very gifted and kind."

        "review_text": "My sister and I stayed at the Carlton Hotel in Tunis the night of April 12/13. Last night of a tour of Tunisia perfectly organized by a local tour operator. We were received at the reception by Mr. Lofti.  I'm not lying about staying at the reception for an hour. Mr. Lofti could not find the reservation. Once found, he couldn't find the payment. Once found, we asked for a basket for breakfast the next day that we had paid for but that, following the anticipation of the departure of the plane, we could not take.  Nothing. Don't move, don't pay attention. Nothing. Then we asked for an additional room. Mr. Lofti, angry and again, not available at all, replies that no room was available. On the site, however, there were still some. Let's move on to the bedroom... Mr. Lofti increasingly rude and pissed off (I didn't understand why...) gave us a nice surprise. A room that wasn't one. It was probably the staff room. The air conditioning did not work, the room and the bathroom were outdated.  Mr. Lofti was unpleasant, showed a cruel lack of professionalism. I wish future customers not to run into this person. A hotel that wants to be of a certain standard, should be careful about the choices of its staff."

No welcome products just liquid soap.  The TV will run for a while then I will call a technician who will repair, then it will go back down again I will wait for another technician, and I will warn the reception that this is all not working I am leaving. The smoke detector lamp remains lit red while you sleep, the technician informs me that this is normal.  Anyway fortunately I only booked 3 nights, and the rest of the week I will go elsewhere.  Personally, I don't go back to it, it's up to you."

        "review_text": "Introduction: this was the last overnight stay in Tunisia. Room booked and paid for by the tour operator who organized the trip for me and my sister, always relying on good hotels.  Lofti, the receptionist, claimed that the payment had not been made: he made us wait an hour before giving us confirmation. We asked for an additional room and also for this reason he made us wait, according to him to confront the commercial office! We took the opportunity to grab a sandwich at a bar just outside the hotel. When we returned, the additional room had been sold moments earlier and we were told that the hotel was fully booked (which is not true as there were 5 rooms available online).  The reservation included breakfast at a cost of 10 euros per person, which is no small thing in Tunisia. Since our flight had been brought forward, we could not use it: since the refund seemed not to be possible, we asked for a doggy bag, and we were denied that too. Later, however, the usher knocked on our room saying that he could take care of it, obviously for a fee.... When we saw the room, we were shocked: it is the worst in the structure, as confirmed by people who work in the hotel (n.242): window that opens onto a closed atrium, therefore completely useless, non-working air conditioning with a rather high temperature inside, an iron column near the bed that holds structural beams, definitely dangerous especially at night in the dark, very old bathroom (I do not go into details) whose only opening is only for the inspection of the pipes, noisy ventilation that operates itself even when the light is off and there is no way to interrupt it. In short, a disaster on all fronts! We have not understood the reason for such a relentlessness towards us; perhaps because we are Italian women? The technical director of the tour operator we relied on also intervened but even he could not achieve anything. We tried to speak to a hotel manager but this was not possible either. To sum up, the receptionist proved absolutely incorrect. The next morning his colleague tried to defend him saying that he is new in the trade: assuming that this is true, it is not justified a similar behavior; in any case, the management all this where is???"

Roasted parts make a disgusting impression. Faucet as well as shower faucet worn and calcified. TV has hardly any German/English channels and no connection with Netflix or other apps possible. In the standard rooms there is no kettle - only the newly renovated rooms have one according to the reception. Apparently, there is an additional distinction between what the 3-star category includes for standard rooms and what applies to the “better” renovated rooms. Bad policies and message to guests.  Door lock is so unstable and broken that you are worried about your own safety and the safety of your belongings. Standard room rather disappointing and sad. There are better accommodations in this price range. Would not recommend it for longer stays. There was a bunch of mosquitoes in the room that were bothering at night. Staff is not interested in helping you and does not respond to the criticism, only after renewed demand we would be moved to other rooms but insects/mosquitoes remained a problem! The staff should have solved the insect problem and prepared the rooms better before the guests arrived. We barely slept. In addition, it is very loud, you can hear every door that is closed and every movement on the corridor. Bring earplugs! Door lock is so of unstable and broken, one has concerns about one's own safety and property. Standard room rather disappointing and sad. There's better for the money. Would not recommend it for longer stays!  The only plus is the location, really central and city center within walking distance."

I had a balcony overlooking the park (spectacular view).  Although the noise the ostriches make at dawn are a bit disconcerting at first.  The down side is that the hotel is not being maintained well:  lights out in the bathroom, the buttons for the elevator were so worn it could take five minutes to get them to light up, etc.    All of this were minor inconveniences.  However, the hotel advertises Wifi which worked well the first day I was there.  The second day it went down and there was no wifi available by the  time I left.  The front desk's attitude was \"what do you want me to do about it?\"  I complained several times but got shrugs in response.    Bottom line:  It is an inexpensive, clean hotel but don't expect any support from the front desk."

After all, the hotel offers a very attractive rate in a nice location in the amazing city. But three things I found very unprofessional.  1. Wake-up calls never came. 2. The reception insisted to keep my passport for \"administrative work.\" Half a day later, I found my passport at the reception unattended within the reach of anyone who walked by. I found a staff and asked him if I could have my passport back. All he said was \"Feel free.\" 3. In the morning of checkout, the lady at the reception refused to take a credit card. My booking accepted CC payment, so I said so. She now said something was wrong with the CC reader and told me to wait for an hour. The hotel knew I was checking out in the morning, but there was no prior warning about the machine trouble. I asked her for alternative options, but she only kept saying \"You have to wait for an hour.\" Not until I raised my voice and explained to her (for third or fourth time) that I had a plane to catch when another staff at the reception went into the backroom, looking very annoyed, to fetch the non-electric CC reader to process my payment.  An average 15 year old would have been more thoughtful and helpful.  Totally and incredibly irresponsible, unwilling and incapable staff at the reception."

At the restaurant the food is varied, fresh but sometimes dishes are cold. In my opinion the negative point to the all included formula are extras (orange juice, mookhitoo...) paid unlike other hotels in the iberostar chain"

Also, the mini club should be open longer! Not everyone has their thinking hat on: I was woken up in the middle of the night by a guy doing maintenance with a compressor on the room in front of my window, and he didn't understand why I was annoyed! They could try harder on the food: in the restaurant you'll still find the old fashioned baine marie containers to get the food from, rather than the live kitchen stations most hotels have upgraded to"

Mostly well equipped though could do with having a kettle and access to an iron. The pool areas cater for all ages and abilities. They have entertainment on for most of the day by the pool side. We don’t usually use the mini club facilities but after hearing how welcoming the staff were, we sent the kids there for a couple of hours on two days- they all loved it, particularly thanks to Hanna. We would also like to thank Khaled the porter, Sassi the waiter, Adel and Mohammad in reception who all regularly went out of their way to be of assistance.   Top tip if you’re a family of 5 with kids- it may work out cheaper and more convenient, to get the hotel to organise a day trip to Tunis/ Carthage/ Sidi Bou Said than to go with a group tour."

        "review_text": "The hotel was advertised on your platform as well as on other booking sites as a 5-star Iberostar hotel high quality services. On the spot, however, it turned out that:   The hotel was supposedly taken over by Iberostar, but honestly: you don't notice. It does not seem modernized or professionally managed.  The first impression was already negative, and unfortunately it did not get any better. From the shower came an unpleasant smell that spread throughout the room. The air conditioning was noisy, indicated 30 degrees, but it was still freezing cold in the room – we had to sleep with thick jackets  At the entrance is only “Mirage Hotel”, there is no Iberostar branding.The services and condition of the hotel correspond to a maximum of 4 stars: unpleasant smell in the room and cold, loud and faulty climate hot system, weak Wi-Fi in the room, and no reception in the restaurant or at the stand no service on the beach nu old lying chairs no longer, (all closed ). Because of these massive shortcomings, we have the last two nieces   leave the hotel earlier at your own expense and book a new real 5 star hotel.  In our view, these circumstances are a clear deception – both in terms of hotel classification and services provided. This hotel does not deserve the name Iberostar – at most mid-range. I definitely cannot recommend it."

However, in reality it looks different with regard to sandy beach etws because there are actually only 2 rows of loungers there and not as many loungers as on the picture because the sea level goes much further out. The service on the beach was mixed. If you are close to the restaurant you get towels and are served courteously than if you are further away. Beach and sea were clean. Dinner problem here were the flies that gladly helped themselves to the dessert."

        "review_text": "We have just come back  from Shems,  we travelled as a large family of 9 children range from 10 to 22, but I can honestly say that the hotel catered for everyone and kept us all busy because it is the staff who make this place what it is most specially the animation team !!... the hotel is clean and pool areas really nice. The aqua park is fab and kids and adults all loved the slides ! The food is actually really really good and varied, however if you have fussy little ones who will only eat nuggets then you will struggle ( they do have pizza every meal and fries every lunch time. Pasta is also available,) The animation team were absolutely fabulous- we are a large family with big characters, but they embraced our craziness and joined in our mad games, they made an effort with every single one of the kids and really made our holiday !!! Thankyou Zico, Ash,James Alfa, and mazi. ( sorry for the names we forgot ) The bar staff were all super they even found F1 for my partner on the big screen !!( apologises can't remember all names !)  On our first day  Med Saleh served us and he told us it was his first day, but he looked after us all week bringing drinks to the pool and chatting- Shems made a good choice employing him !. Now for the very few negatives, the bungalows are basic, clean and for what you pay good and perfect for two people, however we had a 'family room '( same bungalow as a double room with two single camp beds in ) fine I guess for toddlers but we had a 17 year old, 10 year old and myself and my partner, not ideal that there is no door between  bedroom part and lounge part so  no where to change, no privacy, couldn't even change behind an open wardrobe door as they have holes in 🤣🤣they are too small for parents with older children !. My only other moan would be certain parts need some TLC like the aqua park toilets. Overall we had an amazing holiday with very lovely staff who really cared and looked after us all week. This was a cheap holiday, it was 5 star for staff and pools, the rooms are not. It is value for money - thanks shems for a super week !!"

The staff are wonderful, particularly at Reception, the main restaurant and the bar. The swimming pools are lovely - we mostly used the main pool away from the hotel lobby.  The beach was wasnt quite open but looks good, The beach is dirty however this isnt the Hotels fault. Food was a bit limited for choice after a week. Our grand daughter struggled a bit but the pool snack bar was great and we used that a few times. We had italian at the sister hotel and I have to say that was poor. Our apartment was fine but the aircon didnt work and the kitchen area was poorly equipped. Shower water pressure was also not good. Location within the complex was lovely though. All in all, this Hotel was very nice and definitely worth a visit. For all its faults I would recommend it."

The location is super: the hotel is on the grounds of Medina - around shops, cafes, entertainment.  The food was generally good. There was a good choice for breakfast, fresh pastries, Tunisian dishes. Lunches and dinners have sometimes seemed monotonous, but you certainly won't stay hungry."

It is impossible to mention them all by name, but each one of them tries their best and takes care of the guests in the best possible way. I could easily leave my son with them and swim at the same time. They are open, speak different languages ​​and always meet the guests' needs. My son had the best relationship with Sarra, but the rest also try very hard. And even when they are tired, they do not show it. I thank them very much for everything. Mouna is also very nice, she takes care of the hotel-guest relationship. The meals are varied. Everyone will find something delicious for themselves. The hotel is not the youngest but it is maintained in really good condition. Rooms are in good shape. The beach is sandy, large swimming pool and great slides. I highly recommend it to all those who are undecided."

No kettle or fridge in room which I missed as the coffee machines at bar area are turned off at night and your not allowed to take drinks from restaurant. Reception staff very helpful.  Animation team work hard all day around the pool.  For me as solo traveler I found there is nothing to do at night as the shows I felt were pretty child like. Last year I went to a 3 star and they brought in entertainment some evenings which were amazing.  Down sides for me personally was from day 1 constantly being asked by animation team to write review on here and some reviews were written by them.  Food … selection of hot food very poor and repetitive. Plenty salad items on offer. Snack bar only does crepes or pizza . No kids menu here.  In all I enjoyed my stay but would not return as this was my 3rd year in Tunisia and there are better hotels in other parts with more on offer ."

        "review_text": "“We had an amazing stay with friends at the Delphine & Habib Hotel in Monastir! The welcome is exceptional, we really feel at home. All are in the care of the staff — from the manager to the front desk staff, from the self, to the maintenance.  It is one of the oldest hotels in Monastir, being gradually renovated, which gives it a lot of charm.  Every day, they take the time to ask us what we’ve done — our little excursions and walks ‘in the snatch’ version (zero organization, 100% fun 😂) — and they offer us places to visit that only the locals know. They are very interested in our program and experience.  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax, feel well surrounded, and have a real and friendly experience. Thank you to the whole team for this great adventure!”  Far from the far too luxurious complexes that lock you up and oppress you. It was our experience and it is authentic.  Thank you 🙏 to them"

And the lifeguard, Wahid, he was fantastic! Helped my little one with the slide and build her confidence in the pool"

The hotel is in a great location, close to the center, shopping, history. I rate the hotel services as 4*. But I would rate the animators as 5*, their positives, their activity is great, they can entertain, take care of your children, and they have a great attitude and service... everyone was very helpful and nice. But I have to highlight the animators once again, they have a great attitude towards all people, for all ages. So we will be back."

The maids kept the room clean to a high standard, gardeners keeping the place beautiful, spa staff thank you for helping me unwind. The animation team is so good, keeping us entertained with lots of fun and energy! Bar staff keeping the drinks flowing, serving with a smile!  Finally, a big shout out to the chefs, especially Hassen and Wassim. You guys work hard! Thank you so much for the delicious meals prepared and keeping us fed for the 10 days and the waiting staff at the restaurant and management. You are appreciated 👏🏼   Keep up the hard work, and we will see you soon! Thank you all  for being part of my daughters holiday memories!"

We also met the guide Lofti with whom we had the chance to visit the Medina de Sousse (at an extra cost but really worth it, for a very reasonable price), several very interesting excursions are offered by the trip.

We enjoyed the gym, the pool, the children's playroom — which is a real plus in this hotel (thank you for thinking about it) — the spa for a massage session, the More cafe, the restaurants... Really, it was great. The hotel is always clean and smells wonderful. It is a very, very nice place.  But the real added value to all this is the staff:  “I’ll start with Soundous, the masseuse who gave me a massage at the ballot boxes. She was very professional, took her time and took care of me. His words are beautiful and sweet. She remained very focused throughout the session. Her massage drew tears from my eyes. I had a great time and I would be so happy to see her again when I come back! THANK YOU SOUNDOUS!!  “Then there was Asma, a charming hostess who knew how to listen and meet my needs:). Her investment touched me a lot, and she was able to rely on her colleagues Oumayma, Aya and Rym, who very quickly showed that a real team existed. Really, a BIG THANK YOU TO YOU GIRLS!!! I also hope to see you again during my next visit.  “And then Afef, the animator of the game room. When they heard that they were going to leave permanently, the children began to cry. All they did was claim Afef throughout the stay. These were happy moments for them, and it did us parents great good. Thank you for your investment, your smile and your sweetness.  It would be a great pleasure to see these people so dedicated to their profession, professional, and who remain attentive to the needs of the customers.  The hotel is beautiful, large, clean, and offers a lot of services, but nothing would be possible without these people worth gold. Thank you for who you are, and for your professionalism.  Cons: the restaurant meals are average, but the breakfast is full and delicious, and the service remains great!  Thank you to the whole team! I highly recommend this hotel!!"

        "review_text": "The La Cigale has a beautiful, well-kept complex and also nice rooms. Breakfast could be better in this hotel category. Unfortunately, the staff tries to be a bit more genteel than their most distinguished guests. Since we are quite normal, we would be more happy about a friendly and personal warmth. Compared to other 5 star hotels, such as La Badira in Hammamet, La Cigale lacks a lot. Today we had to recode the room card three times. That's not a bad thing. But that an employee comes to the villa and then tells us to pick up the key at the reception is not worthy of 5 stars. Hotel and facility very good, staff and service unfortunately disappointing. I got to know Tunisian cordiality differently in recent years. I hope I experience that even better in the next two days."

        "review_text": "This is the 2nd time we book with family, in this hotel (the 1st time in 02/2022). Between the two visits, the hotel underwent a nice degradation: 1) The hotel seems poorly maintained, quite a lot of wear, imperfections have not been repaired/maintained. Too bad not to take care to keep a certain standing. 2) Wifi does not work, simply, in the rooms (on the 1st). We had to tap and blow up our French 4G packages. 3) The buffet restaurant is not worthy of a 5*. Quite a few stands (grids, etc) are empty, the only new thing is the price which has increased (135 TND for the evening). We revisited the evenings after, same observation. Avoid it. On the other hand, à la carte restaurants (coral and basil), are a better value for money. 4) We recognize a 5* straight away by the quality of the toilet towels that need to be renewed and soft, there they have become dark gray and hard, by passing them by machine, some towels are almost unusable. It's time to change them. 5) Some people at the service are not correct, at the buffet of the BF, a person almost refuses to serve you and he does it with quite a few other customers. Others, when maintaining the room, criticize guests aloud. Finally, we had a mishap, about a request at the restaurant where we were guaranteed a gluten-free product, except that it was not. The after-effects were significant on health and the rest of the stay wasted. It's time to remove a star from this hotel and update it, only to return it later once there's an improvement."

As we are all vegetarians this was a issue as the all inclusive menu was limited for us.  The first day was difficult but once we managed to speak to the restaurant manager he ensured we would have a vegetarian menu.  This was a lovely hotel to stay in and the staff members were very kind to us. The animation team was wonderful and the night entertainment was one of the best I've experienced in comparison to other countries I've visited. Lovely stay and I managed to do  the parasailing which is based at the private hotel beach. The beach is clean and peaceful with only hotel members. We also booked a few excursions such as pirate ship, quad biking and visited the Santorini style sidi  Bou Said about visit was beautiful through the hotel reception team. Lovely hospitality also used the SPA at the hotel. The hotel is very spacious so lots of walking around. The rooms are Tunisian style traditional detail. Very different to where I have stayed in the past but I loved the traditional stay which added to the experience.. wonderful stay.."

We hope it will not be a disappointment in the summer.   The animation team is the be-all and end-all.   And the animation boss before did it sooooo great !!!  If it's a disappointment, we won't come back to the hotel."

The bungalow accommodation is certainly for the amateur, but I loved it, everything they need is available, cleaning every day, changing towels every day, safe is available. No hairdryer, but you can take it to the reception. Nutrition is varied, you won't stay hungry! The sea, the beach, the pool, everything's great! Terrace and beach bars are open, steak bar is open 24 hours a day. Employees and staff are friendly and very cool guys, to any request immediately reacted and decided when necessary. The hotel has everything you need for a comfortable stay and to restore your physical and emotional health. The atmosphere in the hotel is a separate topic! Great!!!! Everyone who works there creates it, but I want to say something about the animation team. You guys are FIRE!!! Worth only of - for them visit this hotel this season!!!! I work all day, evening and at the pool and the beach... the program has different activities: sports, dance and many, many things, as well as evening programs. Incendiary, friendly, positive, energetic and very beautiful TEAM!!!!! It certainly won't be. Guys, respect for you! You made my rest! Love and hug everyone! Thanks to the Samira Club Hotel and everyone who works at this hotel. You are the BEST!!!! I wish you grateful customers and prosperity!

My only sad thing is that we didn’t stay longer"

A very nice spa also and 2 qualitative restaurants. Everything not to leave the resort and good because not much to see in the area except shebika. Guaranteed relaxation. A special mention for the very nice mehlsi chef and for saden who every night reserved us a surprise in the room , including a composition of flowers on our bed for the last evening.  Many thanks to all our very friendly Tunisian hosts. But take care of your environment.  What a sadness to see the ambient filth of this beautiful country."

It’s a short taxi ride to the centre of Port El Kantaoui and the famous Medina of Sousse.Read more",

Excellent staff strive to serve the guest. Very clean common areas in marble and walls in Arabic style. The best the SPA is luxurious with modern whirlpool chambers, sauna, jacuzzi and other excellent quality services in addition to the staff q attend. The food is varied and the pastry part super. Negative points the standard alcoves are small, the balcony also, no air conditioning, towels and sheets do not change them it is time to ask for the change. The bathroom is medium level no toiletries just a soap and a plastic hat, no makeup mirror, the fridge is very old and poorly located, no coffee maker. The bed has 2 small pillows and does not put a bedcover. This is the worst point. The beach is removed from the hotel, it is time to walk along a path, there is no animation on the beach. Regarding the attention if it is true that there is preference for English customers since they are the majority. We were given some of the worst rooms.  Conclusion hotel with specialty for English, senior citizens in the majority. For us a 3 star hotel no more."

There are plenty of loungers and it didn’t feel overcrowded. We had a pool view from our balcony, the room was amply sized and immaculately clean. The food was excellent and varied all week, we met the head chef who was lovely and even offered to cook specially for my partner who is gluten intolerant. There were some gluten free options available daily including bread and desserts as well which were kept separate. All of the staff were friendly and polite and the entertainment team were great, engaging but not pushy. Great value for money. We’ll be back."

Rooms are nice and spacious and well maintained with a good sized TV including UK Channels, Fridge and  a bathroom with fresh towels daily and shampoo, soaps etc.  The hotel has a vast range of facilites including a seawater indoor pool, spa and gym (extra cost) and a selection of indoor and outdoor bars, kids club and outdoor snacks. There is also a private hotel beach with a bar a short walk away. All ther staff are amazingly friendly and greet you when they pass. There is a huge shop in the hotel that has all the stuff you might have forgotten to pack plus a big range of local sovineers. Dining here iis amazing, food is top quality and the selection is vast at all meal times. You can choose  to eat in the dining room or the cafe with waiter service or enjoy a paninni from the pool bar. Soft drinks and coffee are branded products like Coca-Cola and Nescafe but the spririts and beer are local varieties, but not bad!  Every day there are lots of activites organised by the animation team including darts, french bowls, water exercise etc. The animation team are amazing and work really hard to encourage guests to have fun on holiday. Special mention for Mr Bean who does the french bowls and he works hard to make everyone feel comfortable whilst playing the games. This is a Tui hotel and it has to be mentioned that they provide supeb support at the hotel and whilst travelling. My first time in Tunisia but I will return as the security is good, people are friendly and the value for money is excellent. Royal Kenz gets a 9/10 from me overall."

Restaurant : Foreigners are greeted with a smile and service without a request, but the yellow wagon holders are the same and the workers are worried about even the tables in terms of adjustment and the quality of the wagon and knives, so that the water is cold for foreigners and hot for yellow wagons."

Both outdoor pools slightly cool,stated heated didn’t feel heated. Room ok beds horrid felt like sleeping on boards.My mains issues were with the drinks,only 1each of local Whiskey.Rum,Gin and Vodka available no other drinks several cocktails not made fresh ,asked for a Bloody Mary but didn’t serve tomato juice once more most 4star hotels would provide these little extras.Second bribe is the glasses no issue with plastic glasses by the pool area but these were small tumblers serving about a third of a pint.In the main area lager served in small half pint glasses again something you would expect in a 3 Star establishment. You could get lager glasses if you asked for them once more you shouldn’t have to ask.My wife visited the Spa and stated it was exceptional she paid 85 Tunsia dnr .In conclusion some aspects suggest a special hotel but overall it’s the minor issues that spoil this hotel ps nighttime entertainment leaves a lot to be desired,for example on bingo night we were charged 20 Tunsia  Dnr (£5)for a sheet of bingo cards ,they must have sold at least 100 three prizes given out for the first game prize T-shirt Prize for second game bag of hotel goodies and for winning the third game a 30 minute massage just not sure what happened to all the money took on the night (2000 Tunsia Dnr (£500) Thus once more does not reflect 4star entertainment Final complaint Tv only 1 English station out of 40+ channels As stated ok hotel but not 4 Star it falters to deceive"

I particularly appreciated the quality of the restaurant: refined fish dishes, Tunisian pastries... I will keep an excellent memory of the personalized welcome of the hotel guests , the involvement of the staff, attentive and diligent servers , managers attentive to the smallest detail and who ensure the satisfaction of the guests .  The maids do a neat job (thanks to Mrs. Ismahene attentive to every detail).  I will probably return to this establishment mainly because of the exceptional services in Thalasso (unforgettable massages by Mr. Salah , extremely gifted and professional and which contribute to the excellent reputation of this thalasso center as the best in Djerba."

An extra radiator was put in the bathroom to allow us to use it (we usually shower naked 😄). We will not come back again at this time of year, for sure, because our pleasure is wasted...

        "review_text": "The worst thing for me (if he had a flight home I would probably have interrupted my stay): what some call \"music\", namely a sequence of rare notes without soul, without character, repeated every minute, what I say, every 30 seconds, for hours, every day the same. And impossible to escape, I could hear them from the balcony, in some parts of the park, during breakfast, during treatments... and even at the Moorish cafe! There were only in the \"administrative\" parts, reception for example, where one could escape. It was to the point that I woke up in the morning to hear those notes in my head. For me unbearable. This music seems to be a problem for the staff: during the treatment, when I asked to turn off the speaker in the room to hear only what was coming from the hallway, the person concerned would tell me either that he had not heard these sounds, or harsher words like \"it breaks my head\" (sic).  There are also some shortcomings on the part of the staff, shortcomings are difficult to understand in a hotel of this category, in particular: •\tpersonnel who walk into the room at great strides without announcing themselves, which happened 3 times while I was in the room and which must have happened also in my absence. You can imagine the embarrassment of being half naked in front of a lady. •\tat the reception, where requests are properly received, but without more, followed by broken promises, twice out of three; an example: since my robe has been removed without being replaced and there is no cleaning lady in the corridors, the reception, to which I have indicated that I will have treatment in less than an hour, told me that the necessary action will be taken immediately. Now 10 minutes before the treatment, nothing; I then decided to go around the building, finally coming across a charming person who helped me. When I returned from the care, there was still no bathrobe...  •\tat breakfast the services are systematically removed as soon as they are served again, without the managers wondering if the customer will still need them, so without thinking about either leaving them or replacing them.  I still want to point out that the care was very good and the staff generally friendly and smiling, except at the reception, except for the very friendly person who received me on arrival."

I understand that we are out of season, but good from there to close everything except the lobby bar.. Very average catering, it was necessary to announce to your customers that dinner would be served in the à la carte restaurant (1 starter, 1 course, 1 dessert) instead of the buffet before collecting the Half Board fee, something that is a scam in my humble opinion. Caring staff despite the austerity measures imposed."

Catering, the weak point, promise of five restaurants when in reality only one is open for lunch and another for dinner. Besides, the cuisine lacks flavor. Decent breakfast.

We have a large room though but no balcony which is a bit disappointing. The room is clean, the beds are comfy but it’s basic. Air conditioning isn’t working until June !  Food- there’s a good selection of food available at breakfast, lunch and dinner but no snacks available in between. It would be nice to see the pool bar open for drinks and snacks.  Entertainment- it’s a small animation team who are all friendly and provide activities all day and in the evening. A special shout out to Pikachu and Willy who made our holiday really special. We loved the aqua gym in the morning and their friendliness and enthusiasm.  Staff-Also a special shout to Adel who always found us a sun bed and looked after us bringing towels, pillows, tables, cushions etc. All the staff were super friendly in the hotel, they remembered our names and welcomed us every time they saw us.   We walked to the beach one day but nothing was open and it was dirty and uncared for with no staff and no sign that it had been open at all.   The staff really made this a special holiday for us. Get involved in activities and enjoy all the hotel has to offer.   Pikachu, Willy and Adel you were amazing and we’d return just to see you!!!! 🤩🤩🤩"

It is not difficult to travel around the city by taxi or on foot, either for sightseeing or shopping. There is a place to walk. Hotel rooms are standard. Cons: when they take the towels when cleaning, they don't always return them soon. There are no refrigerators in the rooms. They're brought in on request, if you have to and for a fee. I recommend not cranky tourists who do not want to overpay for holidays."

We were booked for it through Loveholidays and were not informed of it by either Loveholidays or the hotel.  Friends and I were shocked and panicked when we arrived late evening. We didn't know where to go or who to contact.  Loveholidays had an emergency phone number but it was useless as I only bought a data sim and couldn't make calls.   Thanks to our wonderful driver from the local taxi firm KBCar, who found out we were transferred to another hotel nearby. He then took us there free of charge.   So if you are booked for it is the next few weeks double check before you leave for your trip that it has reopened. Didn't want to give any stars but had to give one in order to post this review."

Reimbursement of sheets at 25 euros supposed to have come from Italy while for a mediocre hotel we suspect that it comes from Tunis at max 5 euros .. and besides they were yellow because obsolete.  You have to pay 10 euros to have a towel and 1 turkey to have it cleaned. Very petty protocol. I think that's how it is in most hotels, guests are there to pay only.  I was lied about the mini club being said from 3 years old and arrive there I receive an email to tell me that no it is 4 years. Good because the animator tired of the day before shows videos on mobile to children.  See photo 📷  Music at the bottom until midnight windows that move so loud the bass are. We had to change our room to repack five bags without any help.  Here's to our vacation. Fortunately the sun was there as well as the sea."

A dynamic animation team, smiling, really invested and caring. Very nice SPA session really a good time (hammam, scrub, massage). A great stay!"

        "review_text": "This hotel and horrible no variety of food (gizzard, liver and other offal in general) hygiene and deplorable, the animators serve with hands in food dishes a lot of fly and mosquito, sheets and towels very very dirty window that does not close, shower head dilapidated big lack of maintenance. Pool level: the maintenance gentleman dipped the broom in the pool to clean under the deckchairs while we were in the water. We saw once on arrival the only world tourism animators we managed by ourselves for the rest of the stay and return schedules no one guided us.  I do not recommend this hotel too many negatives and again very dirty. Hotel never maintained a shame."

Dinner buffet the first night was great with plethora of food based on meat, while the second night was lesser based on fish. Quality was good but the cleaning of tablecloths and cutlery was horrible. Maitre was rude and the service unwilling. The same was about the breakfast. There are two swimming pools , one outside and one inside, both filthy and uncared. No towels available also. Our rooms were around the main building, bungalow alike, quite clean with enough amenities, no welcome water though and the running water was full of salt making cleaning an ordeal. Anyway the change sheets everyday. Generally don’t expect cleaning by European standards, dead bags, broken and cracked glasses and plates are common site in the restaurant."

The rooms are scattered around with many steps, not ideal for people with walking difficulty. The rooms are clean, not big but comfortable enough especially if you’re alone, there is no complimentary water or tea/ coffee. The bathroom is not big, separated from the toilet, with soap, bath foam and shampoo. There is a hair dryer. Dinner is buffet, average and finishing fast, breakfast buffet is confusing, apparently large but lacking many things (just oranges for fruit, only one kind of tea and hard to find, no choice of cereals, eggs only hard boiled etc). The staff is not very helpful"

The rooms are decent and the overall atmosphere of the hotel is pleasant.  Unfortunately, our experience was marred by the behaviour of the staff, particularly the catering staff. The servers seemed completely disinterested in the customers. We have been repeatedly ignored, forced to raise our voices or be noticed, and have often been treated with cold or even rude answers. No effort to welcome with a smile or to make the stay pleasant. The nightclub was great but the DJ was tense, we sang or danced too much it pissed him off and cut the music   It’s a shame because the hotel’s potential is real, but the lack of professionalism and respect from the staff means we don’t have a good memory of the service. An improvement in this level would really be necessary for the experience to be up to the level of the place."

        "review_text": "!!!!After spending a week in this hotel I can tell you that it is a hotel to flee following its manager and staff. How to tell you that an all-in means what it means, the bar has hours ranging from 10:30 to midnight, the problem in there is that the waiters do not like to do their job they are friendly just with the women, experience going with your wife to the bar and you will see that they will only look at them and not in the eyes, however at 11:45 pm which means that the bar was always open I was asked to drink but the waiters did not want to serve me or anyone else besides they were only slowing down and making return trips in the kitchen not to serve us on purpose, then asking for drink the waiter answers me \"NARDINMOUK I speak with him\" asking me what it meant I ask people there and answers that it means \"race to your mother\" so I decide to go ask him why he says that, he starts laughing in my face then the manager of the bar comes to me and says MY FRIEND THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IT IS A VERY GOOD WAITER HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT. Going to see the manager the next day, he answers me my staff is the best he would not allow to tell you that so I tell him to look at the cameras because I knew the precise moment by asking him that he shows me the video in the same place but 1 hour earlier then I tell him it is not that time and I answer him precisely the time at which it knows past but what he does he shows me yet another moment just before it happens and cuts just when it was going to happen. He denies and then starts to rub shoulders with me and tell me you’re like my son I don’t want anything to do with you I just want you to have a good trip and that’s all , the next day he came to tell me that it was my fault because we were asking for a lot of drinks at that time and that he understood the gesture his employee had made if he had really done it because he still wouldn’t confess. Otherwise nothing else to say super nice housekeeper exceptional hotel just restaurant as at the bar where the staff is not friendly at all."

We stayed at Max's the restaurant affiliated with the hotel run by Whalid (which deserves 5 stars alone so good mood is contagious, thanks to you ) and we had a great evening thanks to him and the wonderful dishes prepared with love by the cooks  Animations are at the rendezvous with animators who want to satisfy us! Frankly I've never been to an exclusive hotel and they change their minds  The spa is also a very good way to relax... it is worth the price, with several formula adapted to each need, we would just miss access to a Jacuzzi;)   The hotel is well maintained... the only negatives we could find there: wifi not available in the rooms but in the living room and double beds so separate not convenient for a couple   Thank you for this week:)"

The restaurant the varied buffets with 2x per week theme dinner in addition to the buffet restaurant, the service is almost impeccable, the staff is professional and always smiling.  Walid (restaurant at Max) it was perfect.  For late diapers I recommend the disco.  For rooms and excursions I leave you to judge for yourself because tastes and colors????.  Thank you 😍"

The bar and outside are nice with entertainment some evenings. The pool is not heated so water too cold despite the good temperatures in October. We therefore preferred the beach of the hotel. There again pleasant staff and little care. In the lobby of the hotel 2 people offer excursions. We must not stop at the typical and somewhat insistent sales methods. They are finally very friendly and did not hesitate to help us when we encountered a problem with transport to the airport, without expecting anything in return. We did the camel tour and it was perfect! The guide is very interesting, speaks several languages. Pleasant walk with tasting and entertainment at the end."

He upgraded my room to a suite for free. Well, the room or now the suite is so nice and big. A/C is not working. Went down to the reception and asked to fix the A/C and got the answer that it’s not working in the whole property for maintenance. Went outside to buy a bottle of water because I lack it in the room. Tried one hour to struggle with the weather and later on, decided to change the hotel. Again went down asking Sami to find me any solution or I have to leave with bad feelings. Such a gentleman, he upgraded me again to a bungalow, means additional kitchen and balcony. Wow, at last I can open the room door and the balcony door so as to get better.  Breakfast is so simple. Location is great, few minutes from the beach.  What I like in there is the great staff and the location of the hotel. Please you have to inform your customers about any maintenance in advance but don’t let them be in."

Bar shuts at 12/midnight but they let you stay in there after which is nice. The blue Lagoon cocktail was my favourite and the lovley waiter in the afternoon makes a yummy green one. He used to bring them to our sunbed which I thought was lovley.   Sometimes it was hard to get a sunbed so I dunno how it is in high season. You are also not allowed to reserve beds.   The food is okay but not very hot but the deserts are delightful.  At breakfast they do nice omlettes The resturant manager Ali is soooo lovley and was always so pleased to see us. He's got really got banter.   I tried eating out a couple times as wanted to taste real Tunisian food and that did not disappoint.   This hotel is more catered to family's and couples. So if your a group of friends this might be a bit boring for you. The staff make this hotel luckily. The beds are like concrete and so are the pillows 😢 but the hotel is clean and friendly.   Momo taught us Arabic on the first day and I thought this was really nice.  Do not buy trips from this hotel the guy is a scammer!!!  I payed £12 For a boat trip with pickup and drop off and dinner and a couple from this hotel was on the same boat and payed £50!! When we got back from the trip the rude man from the hotel was then demanding money from us. I called my travel agent and they said don't pay him nothing you already paid. 😂 So I told him to go away but I should of reported him. The camera man is really friendly and makes you feel like a celebrity every night lol I probably wouldn't stay here again but I would defiantly come back to Tunisia as it's got the friendliest people I've ever met.  💕"

The arrival was super organized with welcome drink, the rooms clean and were freshened up every day. The non-alcoholic minibar was also always filled. All staff were friendly and accommodating. The food was varied, as I said it is an AI hotel where there is everything every day and you can eat something different every day. The selection of AI drinks was really good, you know that differently. You should calculate the price m you pay doet times down to the day. That was 100 euros per day with 3 x food, drinks have end and snacks in between. Not counting the flight and transfer.  Nevertheless, I would have a few reviews: • in the spa area there was no price list, so I have to assume that the prices vary • it would be nice if you could pay by card at the reception, as at the beginning of the holiday a tourist tax is required, which you would like to pay by card"

They claim that it’s not a 5-star, that’s probably true by some standards we have here, but I’m surprised, if not annoyed, that people who pay a little over a thousand euros a week for two, submit such negative reviews.  A “true 5 star” is 500€ a night without side.  If you want breakfast, lunch and dinner, you will have to pay extra.  Here, everything is included, 3 meals a day, real squeezed orange juice for breakfast, pastries etc.  The majority of staff are courteous, hardworking and dedicated.  The professional reception, the whole team of animators present, without being invasive, and with a rare sympathy. This hotel with its feet in the water and a beautiful beach is our happiness, we who come here for the 4th time, the welcome is always marked and friendly. The rooms are spacious, made every day. The food offers a variety of dishes that can satisfy everyone. For the rest, we  this establishment next June. What else! Didier G."

But then the Thalasso especially the reception agent a disaster is very far from the standards of a SPA or a Thalasso the staff is poorly qualified lz equipment aging in short no interest except massages which overall are very well but similar everything depends on the person who will take care of you. A place that seems totally blocked in the 80’s in short if you are not too demanding ... or you like ruined holidays then this is the place for you otherwise run away and especially do not book with Ovoyage"

Many staff in this hotel, they are adorable and very brave because they work a lot. The buffets (breakfast/lunch and dinner) are exceptional, quality and very varied bravo to all the teams in the kitchen we feasted every day. Thanks also to the teams of 2 bars and a cuckoo from France to Mohammed who will celebrate his birthday on Sunday. Very nice complex in general and beautiful swimming pools, secure hotel and guards at each corner with entrance control. The biggest part of this hotel is the entertainment: the animators are uninteresting and soft of the knee and I know what I'm talking about having done animation myself in campsites clubs and holiday villages for 8 years. Animations non-existent and uninteresting like the animators. Who also do their rehearsals around the pool and repeat the same music 5 times before they know how to chain 3 steps. In short, no interest in the animation division  Everything else was super thank you to him."

        "review_text": "Bonjour! This was a nice, clean and well kept hotel with excellent, welcoming staff throughout. 99.99% of the tourists are French, and the wife and I was the other 0.01%. However, all the staff and most French spoke good English, so no problems at all. We even learnt a little French too. There's was a bit of renovation going on outside but nothing to spoil our stay.  A very good selection of international buffet food on offer for breakfast, lunch and evening meal, so no complaints there. As in most hotels you had to book the a-la-carte restaurant and it was pre-order traditional Tunisian dishes, which we enjoyed very much. The all-inclusive drinks selection was more than satisfactory too.  There is plenty of nice quite areas to sunbath, if you prefer, as the main pool has the usual boom-boom music playing most of the day.  The evening entertainment was a bit of a let down (as there wasn't much, if any at all) but that didn't bother us with only being there for 3 nights. However, I'm sure that will change in high season. Day and night, I believe young children would probably get very bored, very quickly here, although, again, this could change in high season.  Djerba centre/souks (only £4ew in taxi) was nice but as you'd expect, lots of bazaars selling the same stuff, every owner wanting you to look around their shop, we did buy a few things but didn't stay long . There was not much going on at the Marina either.   All-in-all a pleasant and enjoyable stay, but 3 nights/4 days was definitely enough for us as there's not much to do inside or outside of the hotel, apart from walk on the beach."

But im sure in the summer season this changes for sure. The beach is in front of the hotel. The water was very clean also. The buffet very satisfactory, very good from my point of view.  You have lots of different foods and the fish is very fresh and it is prepared in front of you as well as the omelettes, the pasta and many more things. The rooms are nice, clean and big, the beds comfortable. Mine had a balcony,  you could see the sea.

The room was cleaned every day, the towels were changed every day, the linen every three days. Animation every day, the child (3 years old) enjoyed spending time with the animators in the miniclub during the day and in the evening at the minidisco. The food is varied and delicious, there is beef, chicken, seafood, lots of sweets, vegetables, side dishes and fruits (strawberries, peaches, melon, oranges)."

        "review_text": "After a long separation from Tunisia, she finally flew back to this hospitable country! She was resting in May 2025, when the season was just gaining momentum. Despite this, the hotel was fully prepared for the reception: everything is clean, well maintained, everything works like clockwork. The hotel is located near the airport, I had the shortest transfer in my life - 3 minutes. This is particularly true for families with children. I had an early run, had no problem solving it.  Rooms are clean, spacious. Towels and linen are new. The hotel's food is fine, thanks to the chef. Everything was delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient. Desserts, fruit, wine - all fresh and beautiful quality. The grounds are not small, there is no feeling of pounding. The beach strip is quite wide, clean, with virtually no algae. The entrance to the sea is smooth, it is safe to drive with small children and those who are not confident on the water. The sunbeds, the umbrellas, they were all there. Internet is fast and stable throughout the hotel except the beach. It's possible to work remotely for whoever is relevant. I would like to pay special tribute to the work of all hotel staff. Everyone works quickly and smoothly, I'm left with the feeling of being in a big, friendly family. The hotel has a massage parlour with various programmes. Salon owner Mehdi (doctor and part-time polyglot) will help to tailor the course to everyone's needs. A professional massage just brought me back to life! Highly recommended! The location is excellent - near the metro station, you can quickly get to both Sousse and Monastir. You can walk around these cities, organize a shopping or excursion program yourself. In summary: the price/quality ratio of the hotel is excellent, I will recommend to my friends and acquaintances. The hotel wishes success and prosperity for many years! Thank you for your wonderful holiday!"

        "review_text": "Choosing with a friend a country for a holiday and the tour operator offered Tunisia. Not long thinking, bought the vouchers because the hotel discounted. And I didn't regret spending my vacation in this country! First of all, the season had just opened and tourists were scarce, there was no poolside, beach, queue for food. And we Russians could count on our fingers. Secondly, of the pros - the hotel's proximity to the airport (first brought, last taken!), near the subway station, the white sand beach, the sea is relatively clean and not deep, there is no seaweed and jellyfish, delicious food in the restaurant (fish every day), wine of good quality, separately prepare pizza and pancakes, polite waiters and always interested in health chefs! Animators - respect 👍🏻 Especially remembered handsome Sophen, who did not obsessively suggest anything to do, such as yoga or stretching, which we were happy to do)) Russian is not spoken much, but one feels that we are missed and the locals are very much waiting for our camback 🤩 Also in the hotel opened a massage parlor, whose owner Dr. Osteopath Mehdi, who worked for a long time in St. Petersburg (!) and speaks fluent Russian. Separately I want to mention masseur Shams 👍🏻 Truly, a professional from God🙏🏻 and I have something to compare. I took a course of five sessions and I was absolutely delighted! My personal recommendation!!! From the downside - you can see that the hotel has not been renovated in a long time. But you can close your eyes and not pick on it too much. I think if the prices of tickets to Tunisia are not draped, the people will go)) I am right, right!"

Everything was closed: the Spa, the indoor pool (empty), the gym, the discotheque, 1 only restaurant open and again, 4 dishes that fought for the few tourists present, no entertainment... a disaster!!! And I am not talking about the pitiful state of the hotel and especially the exteriors: everything is in a state of abandonment. If necessary, the tennis court could be used as a swimming pool... but as the outdoor pool is not heated, it is difficult to swim there! The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly waiters at the bars and restaurants. A big thank you to them because it is not possible to say that it is their managers who lead by example... The \"high places\" are arrogant and not kind at all."

        "review_text": "I'm in a hotel with a family with two kids. The Russians haven't visited Tunisia en masse in a long time and we are missed frankly (Arabs ask in Sousse and Monastir when we will return). Witnessed the start of the season.  The first thing that matters is that the staff really makes the rest better. I've been to Egypt many times, never seen that. To eat: the choice is small but everything is very, very delicious, satisfied, chef well done. Music: God forbid the animator who has such beautiful taste, we get high on this accompaniment. Beach: the best sand in the entire Mediterranean - I confirm. On the beach is safe for any age - very smooth entrance. Ten minutes from the hotel is not only the airport but also the ground subway: for 30 rubles you can drive to Sousse and Monastir, a beautiful plus Tunisia. Bar pile: wine from bottles is great, beer and spill and bottles - delicious. Pizza and pancakes are amazing. The children's slides have also come. The wi fi is chic like home in Russia: fast and stable, incredibly catching in the room and kids playing network games. The hotel is as old as anything in Tunisia, but beautiful, atmospheric. Although the Dessole chain has long since left Tunisia, the positive plume remains, we have nothing to pick on for the amount paid at the start of the season. Satisfied and would return again. The hotel easily changes dollars into dinars. Nouvelair is a great carrier, Grand is a great TO. Prosperity, love for Tunisia. I'll be there in a year, even in Bella Vista if I can. I recommend Tunisia, if the price is not excessive. Because the Turks and the Egyptians have already overstated it. Ah yes cons: beach towels for 10 bucks (inadmissible :)) and tourist tax, we charged 7,000p for two.  Thank you Bella Vista, thank you Tunisia!"

We particularly liked the animation team; they were always in a good mood and kept us entertained. Whether it was dancing in the evening or water polo during the day, you could always have a lot of fun with the animation team. The people behind the bar were always smiling, too. We are very impressed with our first stay at the Skanes Serial and would gladly come back."

We booked Sea view and ended up with Slide view instead. Awful views . As the days got warmer, the AC wasn't working and got told it doesn't come on until the 15th of June. Something we didn't know about before. As it says AC available.  The gym was in renovations. Disappointed again.  They have a nightclub on site. From 11.30pm until 4am. Loud music and vibrations from the speakers. It was horrendous. When asked to move they said no as no rooms were available. Awful   Positive side most of the staff were nice accept the guy on reception. He wasn't helpful at all   The food wasn't for me. But maybe each to their own.  I would visit Tunisia again but not this hotel  Some parts of your it very run down.  I know it was a 4* but the picture lie."

The food is varied, good point for Berber bread 👍 super good. Snacks all day. For cheese , you can't expect real cheese in French... But the rest very well, hot flat salad, dish made minute... Nothing wrong.  Animation side: we were able to do mini disco every night with my daughter. Top animators, bingo evening, fakir, cabaret, Arabic class, a course on Tunisian cuisine. An oriental dance class.  Good point for the mini club 👍, with an animator who takes care of the children to leave us a little quiet to enjoy a little: Lego activities, coloring and puzzles. My daughter had a good time  Excursion: we made an excursion to Sousse and an excursion with the camels and visit a Berber village 👍 although my daughter was scared, everything went well."

A special mention to Samah the waiter who was always very attentive to us during our stay, to the small care and pleasant with the children really a brave and hardworking man and the only one who took the crease to come and ask us what we wanted to drink and if need anything, while with the others it was necessary to claim.  We stayed in a comfortable surface duplex family room but a refreshment would be expected (wallpaper unstuck, no shower wall). The sound insulation is poor and you can hear the noises of neighboring rooms as well as the nearby discotheque.  Beach accessible directly from the hotel with clear water despite the algae but cleaned regularly.  You will have to take the bus or taxi for each trip, no amenities are located nearby, taxis in front of the hotel charge exorbitant prices."

I was able to attend several evenings and activities (mini disco, gymnastic activity). All are super friendly and welcoming. The mini club leader is close to the children and loves working with them and it shows. The kids are thrilled to go and are happy to be together and it’s great to see, especially for a former Mini Club manager like me. I congratulate all the teams who make this stay unforgettable in every way.  Personally, I was able to spend a week of vacation in a beautiful hotel with friendly teams for children and adults alike.  I see pull my hat and I'll see you soon with my little brother who will be delighted to make friends at the mini club."

        "review_text": "Pros: The hotel is beautiful, the outdoor pools are fresh but amazing, fortunately there was the heated pool (stay April/May). Very clean hotel. The buffet is very good but almost every day the same dishes. Kids slides are great!  Cons: I confirm the nuisance of the club until 4am. Animations are missing, darts and pétanque only. The facilitator of the children's club does not take care of the children, she remains frozen on her phone and does not watch! (child found by the pool alone). You don't let kids in swimsuits into the hotel, but women who are, that's okay. You must regularly tip if you want to have cutlery quickly at the table, otherwise it takes time! The garden view is actually a view of a vacant lot where they do work from 6am to put sand back on the beach. Don't think you're going home rested!  Evening themes are not respected, it is day to day because sometimes the room is reserved for occasions (wedding, birthday). Remember to take a book or card game because in case of rain no animation is offered. Really bad because the setting is really beautiful!"

You have to offer a few dinars to the agent so that he authorizes access to the swimming pool with jacuzzi. The rapas have no taste of rotten fruit, especially the cheese, it looks like soap.

The first time it was simply ignored, the second time they said they would take care of it but nothing happened. The bed linen is not changed. So really catastrophic. I have already been to many 4 star hotels in Tunisia but I have never had anything like this. Also in the restaurant: many local people come in groups (on excursions from other Tunisian cities) and empty the buffet in 5 minutes! It takes a long time for the buffet to be refilled... In the room (again): the minibar is always warm. The cooling doesn't work.  All in all I would avoid this hotel! It was our last time here in the hotel."

Half of the beach has become private and paid television does not work. No wifi in the rooms  The food is not enough for everyone and a tail of tongue during dinner For lunch there is one and only fast football outside in front of the hotel and as a result you have to queue for 2 hours to buy a sandwich (the queue in the hotel and outside Also ) Salafists, veiled people, people of all kinds reside in this hotel  lots of fights, noise and problems at night in front of the hotel and the disco. It is better to close this hotel, it gives a very bad image to hotels in Tunisia; NEVER AGAIN will I come back to THIS HOTEL or to Sousse"

        "review_text": "This hotel is located in a great position for Kantaoui  marina. That’s the plus point. Bad points…arrived around 9.30pm and shown to our room. Three light bulbs missing, it was so dark it was like Hannibal Lectors cell. Reported to reception and maintenance man came up straight away. Looked at missing bulbs and came back within 10 minutes to replace them all. This hotel is so dark and dreary I honestly thought it was named after Hannibal Lector (it might be, I’m still unsure). Everywhere you go it’s dark. We never ate here at all and ate out everyday. On our short visit it was rammed with lusty Algerian single men which, for two women is intimidating. My daughter sought help from the pool attendant, he looked after her and kept her safe from all those said lusty men. He was brilliant, can’t fault him. Friendly, protective and he respected women. On the day before we left, two different reception staff said our transfer coach to Enfidah was 9am. Arrived at reception in good time and no coach. Further investigation at reception revealed the two reception staff didn’t have a clue and the coach arrived at 8am so we missed it. A fantastic reception member managed to call us a taxi and we made our flight home in time. We will never go back here. Absolutely awful stay. It was an urgent late booking and we took what we could get. I was not impressed at all. Nice room and bathroom. Can’t say much else in good terms about this place. Definitely not great for lone female travellers."

First what to expect : - 3 Pools : One for Adults + One for kids + A covered one (not free) - Private beach; Gym; Free Parking; Wifi; Bar & Lounge; Night Club (free entree) - SPA (Sauna, Jacuzzi, Massage, Face treatment)(not free)  - The Rooms: Small TV, Balcony; Free toiletries, Air Conditoning, the floor is covered with Carpet The Good: - The best thing about this hotel is its location, it's really close to manny beaches, to Hannibal attraction park, Aqua Palace (Aquatic games); Port El Kantaoui and other attractions. - The food is good, its an open buffet. - The Pools are great, Large and there is one for kids. - The Rooms are clean and with good views; The Shower is Big with a Bath.  - Free entree to the Nightclub except for the weekends  The Bad: - The Wifi is really Slow, You have no Connection in the rooms. - The Rooms are a bit Small and Old, The TV is Small with 4 or 5 Channels. - The Beach is small and full of algae. - The Staff is not that great, some of them are really rude. - The Nightclub is verry loud so expect it to be noisy really late at night. - The Food is good but the restaurant is really crowded; somtimes you have to wait up to 30minutes to get a plate. - Most of the residents of the Hotel are Young Algerians/tunisians, so i don't recommend it to families, especially at night the Club attract a lot of people."

        "review_text": "So I am sitting on my balcony after a bit of changeable weather day. As my trip draws to an end I wanted to review this beautiful hotel. The building itself is lovely to look at and the reception area is clean and impressive.   The staff are all so friendly and genuinely look pleased to see you. They are attentive yet professional at all times. This would include front of house staff to cleaners and gardeners.  Cleanliness - the hotel is spotless you will see staff cleaning constantly the hotel smells amazing because of it. Our room kept pristine by Sonde our cleaner.  Pool area is large with one unheated pool and a smaller children's pool. The temperature is more than bearable with lots of people using it including myself. The infinity pool looks like there is improvement work being done so can't comment on use.  Food and drinks - I have been to many all inclusive hotels but I have to say this hotel offers choices many don't.  Fresh juice in the morning NOT from a carton also smoothie of the day. Again freshly made and included. The salads are amazing and to be offered steak and langoustines as part of buffet !!  A l a carte culinarium - one free meal within a week stay. Easy to book with Tui app.  4 course meal with lots of choice.   Spa - what can I say the highlight of my trip some of the best treatments I've had. Trust me I've had a lot. Hands down beats and cruise ship Spa and for a fraction of the price. Excellent packages offered you'd be mad not to take advantage of this.  All in all feel like I've had a wellness break and will definitely be back.  Well done TUI blue palm beach.!!"

The entire staff are great and can't do enough for you and there's entertainment on the night with some fun activities in the day. The buffet restaurant always had a good selection of food on the go, they had mundane stuff like chips but also had local dishes with peppers, chillies, cuscus, rice and curries etc, they also did themed meals like Mexican where they made fresh tacos among other things and also had a great selection of puddings. So the bad points, which aren't so bad, the rooms were a little tired in places like the shower was a bit wobbly, just little bits and bobs really, our room had 2 single beds rather than a double, but this is nothing that would put me off or detract from the holiday experience."

Food in buffet and in a la carts restaurant was excellent and diverse (unless you’re vegan as the choices there are very limited). Thankfully I’m not vegan so had a lot of lovely meals there. Waiting staff were very attentive and I’d like to mention one of the waiters (Faycel) who made amazing efforts to look after everyone in his area of the restaurant and made people feel special when dining. Only negative for me was that there’s not much to see near the hotel so a taxi (or a walk) to Hammamet Old Médina was a must. The new Médina at Yasmin was not so good. We took the offer of a Sahara excursion and that was definitely worthwhile"

From the warm welcome on the first day to the last early morning breakfast on the last, this hotel does it all with style and a smile. Room-very modern design and perfect, spotlessly clean, Food- What can I say, there is something for everyone and plenty of it. The whole F&B team were just excellent. Big shout out to Ahmed who was there with a smile and a bottle of Rose or a beer at every glance. Animation team-excellent, really worked hard to involve everyone and all I'm going to say is \"silent disco\". If you know you know! Pool deck and beach were fabulous, but please provide sunbed mattresses for pool beds, beach and garden beds have them and my old creaking back would have sure benefited from one. The views from the lobby to the sea really does give you that wow sensation. This is one very good hotel with excellent staff!  Of course there can be some small improvements (hooks in the bathroom to hang towels please) and the aforementioned mattresses' for pool sunbeds, but these really are minor."

        "review_text": "My husband and I, daughter and 5year old grandson stayed 2nd May 25 for a week and we instantly regretted not booking for longer. We had two garden rooms which were lovely and cleaned daily. We were a little disappointed that the mini bar wasn’t replenished or even had soft drinks upon arrival and only water provided.  However, everything else made up for that.  Upon arrival Mayha escorted us to the restaurant to have lunch and showed us around, until our rooms were ready. Straight away we could tell the people made this hotel. Our grandson has severe coeliac disease (not able to eat gluten).  GF bread, pasta etc is extremely expensive in Tunisia. However they tried their very best to accommodate and we always found something for him to eat. We did take our own  GF bread & cereal  & snacks with us etc.   But there was a lot of choice for him. The chefs were amazing and so was our lunch and evening waiter, forgive the spelling but our waiter  Chadll and Karim were outstanding from that first lunch visit they memorised our drinks which were waiting for us at meal times.  Our breakfast waiter Ahmed (I think his name was the exact same) he also assisted us and opened up for breakfast early the morning of our pick up to the airport, so we could eat something. This was very kind and helpful. Thank you.  From life guards, security, cleaners, waiters, management and animation team all so  hard working staff, again unable to name you all, I can only remember Nino & Gorfy and the lovely lunatic who does the aqua HIIT and gym, simply amazing - thank you.   We did enjoy  a catamaran trip which was bought through the hotel for  £37 each ( no charge for 5 yr old) for half a day was lovely and it was safe.  We’ve already booked for next May but for 11 nights this time  and not 7, but we’ve opted for 2 sea view rooms next time as this has the sun on the balcony in the mornings which we liked.   The sea views do overlook the entertainment at night so if you go to bed early I’d pick a garden view.  See you soon and take care x"

The animation team? Good-humored machines! Always there to make us move, laugh, dance... Impossible to be bored, they assured serious 💯  Food level, nothing wrong: we ate well, it was varied and super good. And to recover after all that, the rooms were top: quiet, clean, and perfect for a good night's sleep (or a well deserved nap 😴).  And so... THE ZANZIBAR 😍! A crazy atmosphere, cocktails banging, good music, crazy laughs galore... we would have stayed there all night (actually, we did 😅).  In short, a week that we are not about to forget. We will definitely be back. And you, come as you are, but come quickly!"

As for catering, we feasted every day. Various meals, tasty, and for all tastes. Jean Zibar? An experience in itself! Awesome atmosphere, delicious cocktails, and evenings that we are not about to forget.  The rooms were comfortable, quiet, and we slept really well after busy days.  In short, a perfect week with friends, to do again without hesitation. Come as you are, you will leave with memories full of your head!"

The worst point is standing in the long lines for a pedestrian, let's look at this point because it was so annoying for my family and also for other families we know of the hotel so many of them destroyed and promised not to come back again. Last pay les matelas and even the scratch is really catastrophic, I recommend the adjustment is bad and not working, we also hope to review the prices compared to the quality of their servants is reasonable, and congratulations to every staff working at this hotel, please when you return if these remarks are taken into account and thank you."

Now I wonder how a guard at the entrance of the hotel has more prerogatives and decision-making power than the receptionist or the people of the hotel administration, I will leave you to answer me  For my part I do not hide my disappointment and frustration about this incident especially in the company of a foreign person of Russian nationality...

I had to pick up my things urgently and change rooms at 2:00 in the morning, which disturbed my sleep.  ❌ Full board, even bottled water is charged at an extra charge (4 dinars for a 1 litre bottle).  ❌ The quality of the food is poor, with little varied menus and almost identical every day.

Short to advise against."

In short a Pension that I recommend without hesitation."

The rooms are lovely and clean  beds are comfortable and if you need anything else just ask. The Animation team are great they try and get you involved as much as they can and also put on some great entertainment Djambo is brilliant Pika is great with the kids always shows enthusiasm Dali,Cam,Bilbo,David,Mimo and Rio are exceptional I cant praise them enough they maid our holiday. I do feel the hotel just need to add a couple of things to enhance a customer's experience I feel it would help customer's if all staff wore name badges as this would help to know who is serving you or even talking to you also a couple of pool tables and a dart board would be beneficial for just incase the weather isn't as perfect as all customer's want. Finally just a list visible on the bar of which cocktails are included in the All inclusive.  Finally the idea of being able to buy the t-shirts that the entertainment team wear is a great idea but feel that more colour availability for children would see sales rocket . Loved the whole holiday and looking at coming back next year ."

I don't know who gave them the 4 stars but the hotel really doesn't deserve them.  I would not recommend this hotel at all! is much better in hammamet. I'm not coming back!"

        "review_text": "SCOTT E  I presume you were talking about the group of 6 - 8 adults who after riding the inflatables on the beach returned to the pool after 5pm once the pool bar had closed and most guests had returned to there rooms to prepare for there evening meal etc,  That the said group of adults decided to have some fun in an otherwise deserted area.  In case you had forgotten how to do so it is called having fun on your holiday - i would suggest you try it sometime - you never know you might just like it !!!!  NOW ON TO AN ACTUAL REVIEW OF THE HOTEL ITSELF   The staff are all amazing and nothing is to much hassle for them to ensure you are having a great holiday.  Rooms are a little dated as is some of the exterior but you need to remember you are in north Africa and money is not as free flowing as we have it back home.  Maintenance work was ongoing to the hotel as i witnessed first hand 2 employees scrapping and repainting the rear of the building to make it look welcoming to all future guests.  The food is also lovely with an A la carte restaurant  with different themed dishes served.  we will return to the hotel that is for sure as we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend to anybody."

        "review_text": "The hotel and facilities are lovely overall. As others have said, it needs a bit of tlc but that all comes at a cost inevitably passed on to the guest. It's not luxury but neither is the price. The food was all excellent. No pork products are served.   The highlight is the pool area. It's lovely and peaceful which the majority embrace. Sadly, one squad of overfed, sunburnt and drunk British goons decided to ruin everyone's peace and quiet by screaming and bombing the pool for an entire afternoon.  The hotel is adults only, but some children never grow up.   Nobody from the hotel stepped in, which would have been nice.   This was certainly the exception though and the majority of the time it was lovely and calm. Jamil and Daniel from the Animation team were very pleasant. Encouraging but not pushy and two really interesting guys, full of local tips.   The beach area immediately adjacent to the hotel is kept really pristine. Sadly though, anywhere on the beach not outside a hotel is filthy with rubbish, bottles, half rotten cans etc. It's really yucky and it would be nice if the hotels clubbed together to have it cleaned up.   Nabuel is worth a taxi ride (£5 e/w) is you like the full Tunisian Medina souke experience. It's wild with hassle and haggling. You need to have your wits about you, but it's a lot of fun. If you prefer your shopping a little more serene, there's a great shop outside right of the main gates, just past Marco Polo. The owner is a gem, and all the prices are fixed and great value. They sell everything you find at the market and more.   If you go left outside and walk around 30 minutes following the coast and cemetary, you'll find an old fort and Medina surrounded by o a lovely harbour and restaurant area."

        "review_text": "Stayed for 7 days in May with my partner. Hotel is ideal for an all inclusive relaxing poolside holiday in the sun. Whilst the facilities and the rooms at the hotel are somewhat dated and due a modern update/refurbishment (air conditioning in the room works but is mediocre at best), the staff were amazing and went above and beyond to ensure all guests were happy.   The pool is lovely and very well maintained - with a pool bar that serves beer, wine, cocktails and soft drinks.    The hotel is right on the edge of the sea, which is ideal if guests feel they need a change of scenery from the pool.   The food was really good and exceeded expectations. All diets are catered for. Me and my partner never left breakfast, lunch or dinner feeling hungry.   All guests were civilised and polite to staff.   FYI: Tipping is a BIG aspect of the culture in Tunisia due to low wages. Be prepared to bring cash to exchange to Tunisian Dinar on arrival (Dinar is a closed currency and cannot be purchased outside of Tunisia)   A brilliant stay. Would recommend."

Then 10 mins and tea to cool off a bit, then on to WONDERFUL 50 mins massage, courtesy of the very talented Maram and Naziha. Both were truly excellent and provided exactly what we wanted, pressure wise etc. I have an injury to my arm, and Maram handled it beautifully- massaged, but carefully and thoroughly. The supporting team, Fatem and Awatef (spelling - not sure, sorry!) were helpful and friendly and the whole experience was marvellous thanks to their expertise. HIGHLY recommended. 🙏🙏.

The food is very good and plentiful with a good selection and waiting staff are very friendly and just want you to enjoy your holiday. Although the building itself looks a bit tired now from last time, the room is clean, spacious, and comfortable. The hotel is a little out the way for some attractions but step out, and a taxi is always easily accessible. We just wanted a holiday to recharge our batteries with good food and pleasant staff, so we're happy.

I haven't had anything worse in 5 stars yet. After about 35 x Turkey and 25 x Egypts I can certainly make a judgement. Despite about 100 USD Bakshish a week, we were treated as unwanted persons.  The occupancy was about 90% local guests , who fought at the buffet like it was the last meal and then the 50% just left at the table.. There was only 1 pool where our women could swim in bikinis, otherwise everywhere screaming cheeky kids playing a football in the reception without anyone having any regard for the other guests..    I could write for a long time, but there's no point.  The locals are there in your country and should do what they want - they are there at home .  But please do NOT recommend this hotel with top marks to people from D, A, CH, PL, CZ, SK who are not used to this."

Sousse is a fascinating town, the archaeological museum is not to be missed and the fort (Ribat) is also worth seeing. In the wider area, El Jem is also very much worth seeing. The hotel is fairly clean and there is a pretty broad range of food on offer. Beef is regularly served but (unsurprisingly) never pork. Egg is very widely used (even in pizzas). The beach is sandy and the hotel has both indoor and outdoor pools. The outdoor pool even has waterslides. The best aspect of the hotel is its staff who are friendly, helpful and kind. Some entertainments were provided at 21:00 in the evening. There was a quiz, karaoke, dancing etc."

Couldn’t sit in the bar area due to cigarette smoke so had to sit in the foyer. We were there for 7nights and 5 of those  ended in fights even to the extent that as new people arrived a fight broke out and they refused to stay at this hotel. Food was uninviting so although all inclusive we had to eat out every evening. Pool area never cleaned so sat on sun beds surrounded by fag butts and dirty tables. Don’t even get me started on the so called beauty & Spa. This was a joke. Will definitely go back to Tunisia as the people were lovely but I would recommend giving this hotel a wide birth until they sort the whole place out."

The sheets on the table were hardly changed and looking dirty. The bathroom shower cloth was full of mould and the AC was not working. The curtains in the room needs washing as we daw blood stain and the chairs and tables in the balcony needs cleaning in fact we had to request a room change and lost our sea view room which we paid for. The dining area needs an overhaul.  But as I said the staff are very friendly."

Staff couldn’t do enough for you, the evening entertainment was always a laugh. I have to say, there was never a dull day, it was a bit like an episode of eastenders with some of the guests, but everyone chats to everyone and it’s generally a friendly atmosphere. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like the 4 and 5 stars were used too. But we would pay around £1200 each for that. We paid just under £400 total for 2 people and added on a case. I have to say for what we paid I really can’t complain."

The advertisement photo is deceiving as it’s really the most beautiful wall to look at in comparison to the rest of the hotel.  Restaurant and bar area is like an old man’s club dim, fill of smoke and smelly. The room was standard, clean sheets, vanity table and a wardrobe but outdated. The hotel needs a face lift. Also, it doesn’t not a beach as stated except an extremely busy road so be careful! If you intend in booking keep in mind this is no a family friendly hotel it’s anything but.  Finishing on a good point is the location it’s between Yasmin and Hammamet but you’ll need a taxi."

The room was clean, with simple but sufficient comfort for a short time. Too bad there is no wifi, but it remains acceptable. The breakfast, although not varied, is quite correct and satisfying. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. It is an ideal choice for a stopover or a short stay. Thank you."

Very noisy. We changed room 4 times for different reasons. My watch was taken on the 2nd day from our room. Some rooms do not have a safe and it was not explained that the safe is at reception. Food was awful we booked half board. We had to pay for water with our meals. Every evening you had an option of 3 choices and the same dessert every night water melon or honey melon. It says at the front of the hotel that there is security there isn't  wifi is difficult to get in most rooms. No entertainment as it states on the holiday advert. It also says there is a spa there is not. The pool was not very clean so keep your head above water. We all had stomach problems and had to buy medication. Please just book somewhere else."

Breakfast was included although nothing special it was fine. Reception were friendly and although I had to change my room this was no problem. The manager was very helpful in changing my room. The food is reasonably priced and u can get service to the poolside which was great too. There's a friendly lifeguard and helpful restaurant staff there. The rooms are adequate some perhaps bigger and quieter than others so ask for a quiet room as some rooms overlook the restaurant/bar courtyard below which comes alive with young Tunisias at night. All in all a very good attractive hotel with an excellent price and great pool. 👍"

Negative Limited breakfast no pastries just bread, tomatoes, cheese, jam, coffee luckily you have bakery and cafe next door... Far from the beach c the expedition to get there cross a road full of cars difficult to cross then take stairs then recross a road no pedestrian in short 10 minutes to get there c the weak point if you like the beach don't come here though if you like to party and drink this is the perfect place Bar for beer fans, lots of men, I don't recommend it for single women Or for 1 night or 2"

On the plus side, despite arriving early, we got a room around 10 without having to wait for the day to start. There is an exchange office on site, you can exchange dollars, euros and also pounds, yen or francs and Danish crowns. They have their own piece of beach and 6-7 positions with sun loungers. There is a small swimming pool. There is a restaurant on the patio, good prices, pleasant and very large portions. Breakfast I read a lot of opinions that it was a roll with jam. Today, however, there was cold meat, eggs, white ricotta cheese. , jam, yogurts, baguette, cucumbers, tomatoes, plain and chocolate croissants, and sand cake. Coffee, tea, orange and peach juice, very nice service. The downside is that we have a room above the patio and it is very noisy at night until 2:00, there is music, voices, it is a lively restaurant. Considering the price - a very good choice"

Rooms were cleaned every day, bed was decorated very nice way, but it was some dust on the furniture, there are put soap for us on the 4th day.  Hotel has excellent local, because it's on the main road and there is bus stop - buses to Tunisia, Yasmin Hammamet, Nubel and Medina are available. 2 roads needs to be crossed to go to the beach, it has sunbeds and sun umbrellas. Wather is  amazing  beautiful. I  recommend this hotel and definitely if I have a chance will visit again."

I'm staying there last two years, and I appreciate so much the development of the hotel. Many things are not changing and this is the positive side, many things changed in a good way and there is no negative side at all. For the people who just thinking to visit this hotel I wanna suggest you residence. The hotel is sittuated in a very good part of Hammamet, between the old center and not so far from Yasmine Hammamet. To get to the beach takes about 5 min by walk. Inside the hotel there is a small garden, pool and bar. Prices in the hotel not so big, I would notice that some things costs less then in other places. The food is really good, and tasty. The staff of the hotel is the best staff in the world! They are so kind, they can help you 24\\7 and they made my stay really great!  Thanks to all the people who work in residence! We love you so much and hope to see you soon!"

Then he called us , screamed at us for forgetting to close the doors of our car ( my father is old and sometimes he forgets ) so I went down stairs and we argued about the whole situation . Thank God we were staying there for just one day . And by the way , they don't have enough food in the morning for everyone so must hurry or  you will end up with some bread from two nights before and expired butter ."

        "review_text": "We were in Hammamet 2 weeks in August and just back. We are 2nd time in Residence Mahmoud and 17th times in Tunisia. I would like to say a big THANKS to the all staff and the owner of the hotel. Since 1st time there , we are like at home in residence. All stuff there work many years, so they make the atmosphere there.  In brief about residence: The hotel isn't new, but the owner repaired rooms, reception and bar inside the hotel, so the hotel looks very light, style and very clean. You can walk without shoes everywhere. The rooms aren't big but very comfortable, clean and light and there are no same rooms in the whole hotel.  About food: Food is great. they make food very tasty, and sometimes one portion is enough for 2 persons. You can have a lunch as in the hotel (the price is absolutely acceptable) as outside in the cafes. There are many cafes next to the hotel, so there is no problem to eat smth.  As I wrote before, the staff of the hotel is amazing, I love each of them, they were taking care about us and all guests, they are friendly and very cute. They made everything, that I wish going there back asap.  The beach is near the hotel, about 5-7 minutes by walk, there u can find chairs, plank beds or pillows as u like. By the way in the hotel there is a small pool, where u can also stay to have a sunbath if u are lazy to go to the sea.  In the end I would like to say thanks to Mahmoud and the all staff of the residence that they made our staying so great and see u soon, I hope.  Your faithfully Anna S."

They just kept telling us to get on our bus and leave. All they did was time waste until we had to go unless we wanted to miss our flight. The picture is of the manager that didn’t help at all and actually hid in the back when he got caught with his lies and then proceeded to call my girlfriend a liar.

        "review_text": "On arrival we where made to wait the standard 3 hours for our rooms , this was a bit of a hassle , we where given a room on the Lower floor which I complained about and was moved the following day upstairs, the second room 269 was very good . It had been recently renovated and my holiday was great thereafter . The animation team work endlessly to make sure guests are happy and content . If you tell them no they accept it and move on , special mention to Tony what a man he is , also anime and mono are great :) doussa on guest relations is great fun and always stopped for a chat AYE  and yuseff in main buffet area was a fantastic waiter always had my table ready , anwar in the bar and the young boy on the beach bar where also great at topping up drinks. My only negative is I had to take my paperwork to the gym daily which was an absolute hassle . This should be free . I have stayed here twice now and with your staff being so good I would come back again . A little tip goes a long way in this hotel , anyone reading reviews it’s not five star you are absolutely correct but you don’t pay five star prices either .! Wouldn’t hesitate on using this hotel on my next visit tonight Tunisia which I hope to be soon"

        "review_text": "First of all being a small group tour operator myself and having worked with many operators and travel agencies for 8 years; I was very surprised by the negative reviews that do not correspond in any way to the reality of the hotel. The criticisms are unfounded. I am currently with my partner at the Royal Thalasso Monastir Hotel. The hotel is beautiful with a beautiful modern decoration and very nice.all the staff is kind and attentive. The service is impeccable on all levels. The rooms are comfortable and the cleaning is well done every day (with a small tip. , , you have all the attention). The setting is very nice and the outdoor pool is great, plus an indoor heated pool. The food is varied and delicious. There's really a choice. Fresh and pressed orange juice is offered. In other hotels, it is paid. The hotel offers a very peaceful setting for a relaxing holiday. It deserves these 5 stars by Tunisian standard. Special thanks to Mr chokri Atiri for his very warm welcome and for room 518 . Thank you very much. I highly recommend the Royal Thalasso Monastir. Make your own experience and beware of negative or misleading reviews. Mme Camaret Camille"

        "review_text": "Hotel room was large and clean- bathroom a little dated. 2x 1.5L water bottles replenished daily in the room. Walls are very thin and often woken by neighbors. Location- nothing near by, some water sports on the beach and a hotel further down with a shop inside. Take cash to change for dinar- won’t do this with card.  Pool area was nice, pool kept clean. Always enough sunbed both at the pool and the beach.  Animation team are lovely, always trying to get you involved however if you’re not interested do soon get the picture and leave you alone. Pool/beach bars didn’t have the largest selection of alcohol but we don’t drink much so wasn’t an issue for us. Soft drinks were branded, latte was nice.  Food was repetitive like most all inclusive however we always found something to eat and didn’t go hungry. Drinks were waiter service at lunch and dinner, again staff really helpful and always keeping drinks topped up. Staff were all very attentive, polite and always happy to help. We visited the spa for access only which was relaxing which cost about £25 for two people.  We went as a couple and wasn’t much entertainment for kids however this may be different in the school holidays. Some reviews are very negative on here but for the price we paid we did not expect the 5 star luxury we’ve had before where we have paid a 5 star price. If you remember that you won’t go far wrong, we had hot sunny weather, relaxed by a pool and didn’t have to cook and clean for a week for a very low price! So I can’t complain! We would return for a cheap week in the sun!"

Always smiling and ready to help with everything. For the first time I was travelling with wheelchair and was worried that we will not manage. It was no need to. There was always a kind soul ready to help. I would like to thank people working at the pool and sea bar for all the support everytime we came there. Also animation team and pool lifeguards. I would also love to thank waiters in restaurant for making us feel welcome and special all the time. Dear management you have fantastic people working there. Food was excellent and hit my taste buds directly. Wide selection of meat, pastas, and salads etc. Room was nice and clean. We kept finding hearts and swans made of towels which we found cute. I would give 6 stars with ease if trip advisor allow that."

Prices for drinks both in and out of hotel is good.  Area on first appearance is run down but the New medina is 5 mins walk away and is vibrant with the added bonus of the Rovers Return, if you fancy a drink and chat with ex pats that run it. I’m told they do a good Sunday lunch if that’s your thing. Almost opposite the hotel is a local cafe, coffee, soft drink and excellent flat bread or panini’s £8 for 2. It’s not everyone’s choice but VFM it is excellent, we were HB not sure I would want AI."

When booking the holiday the travel agent told me that the full board plus was soft drinks with my meals, this suited me just fine! On arrival none of the staff helped me with my luggage! I was slightly earlier arriving for 2pm check in and I was told that I could go and get lunch in the hotel restaurant.....I had to pay for my lunch and my soft drink, and this left me pretty baffled as I was there on a full board basis!  I decided to ask the hotel manager (who was extremely cold & unwelcoming) what the full board plus entailed..... He told me that includes the use of the pool area, the restaurant, the gym! and all the hotels immensities! When I explained to him that I was told that the full board plus was all meals including sort drinks he dismissed the matter and point blank said that I would have to pay for any soft drinks, tea and coffee in the hotel!  This hotel is promoted as a 4* star hotel but is more like a 2*star at a push!   My bedding got changed once after I requested it be changed, my bedroom had many faults eg. Drawer cupboard bottoms sliding out! Door knobs hanging off, the hotel is badly needing a revamp, my balcony looked onto a wall, it was a terrible experience all around.  The morning came to check out and the nightshift staff were prompting me to tip them, but they had done nothing for me, and when I said that I had no money left, they said well you go outside and wait, I felt again extremely disappointed, and once again I got dismissed from the staff...... My transfer arrived to take me to the airport and no one helped me with any of my luggage to the bus.  This was my twelve time visiting Tunisia, I have always had a warm reception from the hotel staff, I have loved my holidays to Tunisia but my experience at the Florapark hotel was so sickening and disappointing that I'm not sure if I'll return."

We can eat healthy, He always has a very nice background music,   Rooms are clean  The director is always present  Maintenance team is still active  The people at the reception are very welcoming and smiling The waiters at the restaurant are helpful too and very attentive  And work hard from morning till night and with a smile,  Host Rami is very smiling , and puts good music around the pool outside of nap time , it sets the mood ,   Djelloul The lifeguard is also very kind, very attentive,  And at the restaurant, we were very well served too  We had dinners with violinist, With saxophonist ,   A good atmosphere prevails in this hotel  Quiet for Adult only where people want to rest   Don't dwell on details such as small bugs or a rusty tap or a broken wrist, It happens, but the main thing is that on reporting it gets fixed.   For mice,.I don't think there are because there are plenty of cats spinning.  There's no trace of mice.  Beautiful hotel, good atmosphere, very nice location,  Very good serious team,   Friendly staff.  I encourage them again,  I hope we get back to that soon.   Raid and Ines."

Knowing that we went on our honeymoon, the sheets were dirty , the pillows were padded with sponge , there was no duvet on the bed and the towels do not talk about it! We went to the reception to claim they told us to go to dinner first! And at the surprise restaurant... there was a mouse that was quietly walking around! The worst part is that when we told them we weren’t believed accusing us of wanting to cause trouble"

        "review_text": "Lets start with the good - flights and transfer were fine. First impressions of the hotel was good. Staff were friendly and loungers by the pool were comfy. Breakfast was nice too - The chef had great humour and I had a omelette most days. If you don't like eggs, you were pretty stuffed though.   Hotel room - Broken balcony door (how this has not been fixed I do not know) - we could have asked to change but we had unpacked by the time we realised. Air con worked but wasn't cold, just blew out room temperature air, even though it was on the coldest setting. We went in May so I can only imagine how hot the room would get any other time of the year. Then the shower, if you can call it that. Hot then cold whenever it felt like it and next to no pressure at all. It was laughable.   Food - we were half board. As mentioned breakfast was ok! Dinner though, very bland. Same type of food every night. I lived off rice! We decided to go out one night but found the same - very very bland. Cocktails also not good.  Pool - nice pool but what really let it down was the volume of the music. The hotel has a member of staff just to sit and do the music all day. Mixture of music but so loud, unnecessarily loud. If you wanted peace - yeah, good luck!  Area - As a whole I was not impressed. Very dirty, beaches also had litter everywhere. Because of this we decided not to have a beach day.   With the rules on their currency it meant we had to get money out there. I would really recommend taking cash out with you and exchanging it. Unfortunately we didn't do this and had to find a ATM. If we had the cash originally the hotel would have exchanged it there and then on check in.   Everywhere you go people are always trying to get your attention. Friendly, yes but its always to con you into buying something. I really felt the pressure from everyone and in the end, we ended up being a bit rude telling everyone no thank you and not stopping to chat.   We made the best out of the holiday but overall, I would not return not only to the hotel, how its a 4 star I will never know but to Tunisia. Shame. I hope writing this will help others as I would have loved to have known this beforehand."

        "review_text": "We stayed 10 nights, very disappointed,  in need of refurbishment,  public areas are clean, rooms not so much, reported several complaints to reception, all dealt with quickly. All fittings need replacing,  taps very difficult to operate,  shower tap broke off in my hand.all drains blocked.  Water leaks from shower. Several lights not working . No tea/coffee making  facilities in the room. Provided after several requests,  two cups ,a few tea bags, no coffee ,sugar ,milk or spoons. Purchased from local shop. Hotel discourages guests from bringing in food and drinks also water. Good selection of food,  buffet style.most of it was barely warm, mostly cold. Good selection of fried eggs and fresh omelette made to order.  Coffee provided for breakfast was served from out dated machines Luke warm and tasted terrible Microwave is provided in the restaurant to heat the cold food, but was not functional  All Inclusive is a joke, one bottle of water provided with evening meal. All other beverages must be paid for at all times Bar man under served spirits, when queried ,denied it aggressively.  We ate out several times at various restaurants , all very poor quality. Over all very cheap holiday if that is your only requisite  ideal if you want to spend every day by the pool and tan. No real activities in the area, not even descent walks The entire area is just Hotels. Shopping is shocking experience. All shopkeepers try to rip off tourists, we witnessed several horrendous transactions Benidorm is a million times better, not that we would return there. We will never return. We are seasoned travelers.  This was our worst experience. Go at your peril"

I cannot single out any particular animation member they all did a great job morning through till midnight .  The rooms were nice and big with a bath and shower within bath . The hotel exterior was being painted and carpets in hallways being replaced whilst we stayed disruption was minimal . The food was  excellent always something new to try ( did mention to staff the labels needed to be better as fish described as fish not which type of fish - we ate a lovely one but have no idea what it’s called . They said they would be making labels better )  the location of this hotel to port area 7 minutes walk and beach at hotel soft sand with plenty of sunbeds . I would definitely recommend this hotel and shall return . And forgot to mention bar staff they were excellent too ,lovely friendly and waiter service to sunbeds perfect"

Everything is dilapidated, left abandoned, badly maintained, the furniture is degraded, the walls cracked, the mattresses in an unusable state, the carpets were very dirty, the food was worthy of a boarding school than a 4 Star Pension, very little varied menu, besides nothing was eatable that we had to order food from the outside so as not to starve, the \"all inclusive soft\" included only coffee or water, the pool space was so catastrophic that we could not stay there, the staff was rude to the point that a maid allowed herself to enter our room while we sleep without any respect for our privacy, the towels were dirty, and icing on the cake, we were there at the same time as a seminar for Salafists or whatever, making our stay a horror."

The hotel is very dirty and poorly maintained. There are stains everywhere, whether on the curtains or the carpet, which seems to have never been cleaned. The lack of maintenance is obvious.  In addition, there are no electrical outlets in the rooms, except the one that powers the fridge and TV, making it impossible to charge our phones. The bed was broken and despite our call at 2pm to change it, no one came until 6pm. The key to the room was working very hard and now it does not turn at all, leaving the door stuck.  We're not the only ones complaining. At the reception, every newcomer seemed to have a problem: air conditioning not working, elevators broken down, etc."

We arrived at this hotel only to discover it was a \"non alcohol\" Hotel. Which in the adverts for the hotel it stated it has 3 bars with a picture of a champagne glass beside it. My wife was constantly verbally abused by the guests due to not covering up. As for the dining buffet the guests were greedy and wasteful. They would totally fill their tables with food then leave about 65% of it, leaving the place in a mess. The poor waiting staff could not cope with the clearing up.     The hotel was poorly maintained virtually every light  wasn't working and only 1 out of 5 elevators worked. As for stating the hotel is in Monistir, It was in Skanes a total dump of a town about 20mins from monistir.       We were relocated to this hotel by love Holidays due our previous hotel not being available at the last minute, We wish now we had cancelled!!       We moved hotels paying with our own money after hiding in our room for 3 days due to the tension caused by the guests. Love Holidays were no help.      Avoid...."

Problems encountered during our stay include:  1. **Cleanliness of the room**: The room was dusty and missing sheets, which is totally unacceptable for an establishment of your standing. 2. **Equipment**: Several electrical outlets in the room were non-functional, which significantly hindered our comfort. 3. **Meal quality**: The cutlery was often dirty and the quality of meals was very poor, far from expectations for a hotel in this category.  These inconveniences have greatly impacted our experience and leave us very dissatisfied.  To flee"

It’s dirty, worn out and dated  The inside of hotel is yellow and feels like your in some nicotine stained building  Some of the staff are lovely but if u have any issues don’t even bother with the guest relations manager as he is a nasty intimadating man , accused of breaking a tv in room and demanding I pay 350 Dinah for it although I didn’t break them accused me of being drunk and pulling it off the wall . Locked out of hotel room until under duress I had to pay  Asked to speak to manager every day and was always being told come back tomorrow . Manager was never in. ? Food absolutely disgusting and covered in flys  Once you found food that was edible you then had to find some plates or dishes that were not dirty to eat from  And if you want a drink , you can always use the plastic cups that have fag burns in the bottom of them  There is no food for children to enjoy and if they are hungry and u decide to go to the shop in reception you can always enjoy out of date crisps as a quick snack !  You can always relax by the pool Or in lobby where u constantly have some chubby little waiter constantly saying you look after me I’ll look after you lady , outside hotel the taxi drivers pee up the walls so it constantly stinks if urine ! Nothing is lite up at night making it a death trap For children as there is a path that leads right to pool from bar so if a child was to run off they would land in pool and no one would ever no  Pool Shuts every day at 6  This hotel is just awful I’m so disapointed that I worked hard to pay for a holiday that was awful  When booking this holiday the pictures looked stunning but don’t get hopes up as I think the pictures may be a few years old  I need a holiday to get over this holiday   Tbh you have to be drunk to stay in this awful depressing place"

The food was very hit or miss and I experienced an upset stomach for 7 of the 9 days we were there, but unable to pinpoint the cause, although the water from the coffee machine tasted of mould at our final breakfast. We were not able to have a kettle in our room, the receptionist seemed to think it was a funny request, but it may have saved my bad experience. Our sea view room had a very limited sea view and was very close to the very loud entertainment area, but thankfully the music stopped at 11pm. We had to wait 4 hours for our room on arrival, and although we were told we could get an early breakfast on our last morning, because we had an early flight, this was not the case, if fact they lost the keys to the restaurant and so it opened late, giving us 15 minutes before our transfer arrived. The indoor pool that is advertised was empty so could not be used, the outdoor pool are clean and well maintained though. There is no information given about facilities or activities, which would have been helpful. The first holiday I have ever had that I wasn’t sorry to leave!"

The infrastructures are neat, surrounded by green spaces that make the setting soothing and pleasant. The room, spacious and functional, met our expectations.  The hotel seems ideal for summer: outdoor pools, children’s playground, private beach and bungalows. Breakfast was varied and quality, served by a smiling and attentive staff – a real plus. The SPA centre is also worth a visit for a relaxing break.    2x points a little disappointing for such a beautiful establishment, however:   - Reception & departure at reception cold & very expeditious,  - The method of information on checkout times (a paper slipped under the door!!!!) Very surprising & really useless!! Especially in low season!   Overall, the experience remains positive. This property is a good option @ South Hammamet."

What a nice surprise upon arrival the hotel is beautiful the rooms are perfect and cleaned every day. The bedding is excellent! The restaurant remains a buffet like all buffets some dishes often come back mostly at the starters but all the dishes were very good and varied every day. The staff is so nice and helpful whether at reception, bar or restaurant. The animation team is also very nice! The hotel is very clean wooded and lots of greenery. I also recommend Samir in the hotel that offers excursions (the catamaran is top! ). Massage services are excellent and very inexpensive for a one hour service. In short a perfect holiday and I can already announce that next year we will return to this hotel with our eyes closed.  Thank you for everything and see you soon!"

Very noisy hotel due to all these young sportsmen gathered, who are the kings of oil and we may have complained about the noise (especially at night), we quickly realized that at the hotel it was the last of their problem. No or little animation due to the presence of handball players.  Beach not according to what was advertised. Disappointed with our week, not restful. Beautiful outdoor pool. Friendly staff"

We arrived and nothing but the best experience from every single member of staff. From start to finish.   Felt hot so the staff got the fan from the security guard to keep our children that little cooler.   Fussy in the restaurant the chefs made a special pizza to my request.   NOW the entertainment team - WOW! We have travelled to many inclusive 5star hotels and never had the dedication that this team provide day in day out even missing a day off to come and wish my wife happy birthday.   If your looking for decor then it’s not for you if your looking for a hotel that needs some support and want some real fun to let your hair down with games, care and real genuine attention then give this place a shot and ignore the bad reviews.   This place can only get better as long as the Animacion team remain!!!’"

A few bits they could improve on.  We have lost a few nights sleep with fire doors banging all night as the latches are broken.  Some slides for the kids which they loved!

        "review_text": "Well as you can see by the title 3 visits in one year,the hotel must do some things right. Not a perfect score though but let's leave the negative stuff to the end. So No 1 for me is the complete Value For Money you get from this 24 Hour All Inclusive. The Friendliness of the staff whether it is bar waiters,food waiters,animation team,cleaners,gardeners and reception. Special mention to Ben \" my brother's,kept me supplied with various drinks during the day,water, Mint tea,B52 and Vodka Sprite. The rooms are a bit dated but very clean and maid very good. Entertainment team led by my friend Rio are a new team but very good.Only slight criticism is in the last year nothing at all new.Same shows but good  nonetheless. So now we come to the main negative the Food. Firstly I will say that you will never starve at this hotel but sometimes the choice and quality of food let's them down. Breakfast was ok with Omelette and fried eggs and some pastries.Toaster is a waste of time. Lunch at Wok with Sammi with Pizza,Noodles,fish was pretty good.But in the beach restaurant pretty poor quality and a lot of things cold. During the day from Noon to 6pm beside the Pool there is a pink burger van,and to be fair their burgers and panini's were pretty good. Now for most people after day on the beach theirmain meal of the day is dinner.But this has been the main bone of contention formost people.Choice and quality are the 2 main words that come to mind.As I explained to a manager it is not more British style food I wanted but more good Tunisian food like Brik.Yes they went and made me one and it was on menu most nights after that.Ihot treated very well last few nights and they even asked me night before what I wanted next day.Iy will be interesting if they continue to improve in this aspect. But 10 out of 10 for listening and improving last few days of my hols. So to sum up if you want Value for Money,friendly staff,great entertainment and plenty food and drink come here. If you are a huge \" Foodie\" not the place for you. I will be back in November keep the food improvement coming along😎❤️"

Whilst we ate in the restaurants at the beginning, we ended up having all melas on the veranda overlooking the beach.  For breakfast we were given a list to choose from, but for other meals just ask and they will try to help. We chose  a BBQ one night which was very nice.  Mini bar fridge was full on arrival with branded drinks, came around often to see if we wanted anything more. Asked for some water, got 12 bottles, asked for a g and t, got a litre bottle of gin. Bottle of Schweppes tonic, a plate of sliced lemons and a bucket if ice.  Wi-Fi also good in the room, even streamed a movie on the iPad, no buffering. Overall a very relaxing holiday and great to reset."

The food is repetitive , no sandwiches for lunch just breakfast dinner & dinner. No ice lollies either.  Not really anything around so if you just want the beach and a pool this is perfect.  The animation team here made my holiday, along with the bar staff and waiter they really do deserve a pay rise they have such long days and are so hard working! Always smiling and enthusiastic! My 6 month old had the best time due to the animation team.  The hotel is clean and constantly being cleaned. Everyone is friendly. I probs wouldn’t come back due to food and not anything really to do near by but we made the most of it!  Also the staff here are on around £5 a day in English money Wich is so sad because they are so hard working!"

        "review_text": "Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. This hotel is advertised as a 5 star, I would give 2 stars if it is lucky! Also stated it is 30 minutes from the airport, well it is at least 4 hours. Have stayed around the world in several 4/5 star all inclusive hotels and some are not so good as others, accepted. But this place… We are on holidays, we work hard all the year round and enjoy good wine and food. Drinks are served in plastic glasses, they are warm and not nice. So if you get the last glass of wine in the bottle around 22:00, they say “it’s gone “ and won’t open any more!! We did pay for all inclusive, but it is just not delivered. In the bathroom, there are holders for toothbrush cups etc, but no cups!! Food is average, well below average. The a la carte restaurant (there is only one, but advertised at three) is open three nights a week and the lovely restaurant manager Mr Mourani or something made sure we were booked in every time. Also this hotel is advertised as “ in the heart of the new tourist area”. Well, outside and for the walkable distance, is just wasteland and roaming dogs and a few restaurants. Please note, if you like to walk and stop at a bar for a beer, they do not serve any alcohol whatsoever outside the hotel. Our air conditioning stopped working first day and we reported it at reception and he told us “all stops in October “. Blatant lie as our room cleaner fixed it. Also it was remarked by a group of young Tunisian men in one of the cafes, that I was not wearing a hijab.  Top tip, bribe the bar staff, give them £10 at the start of your holiday and you will get real glasses and slightly better drinks.  Even better tip, DONT GO!!!"

The hygiene of this Hotel is poor with guests getting sick, food standards and selection was the worst we have ever experienced in all our travels uneditable possibly the only all inclusive we have lost weight. The sunbed mattress were sticky and done the dinner mats in the restaurant unclean and The Entertainment more enthusiasm in a primary school play. The Hotel is 1hour and 40 minutes from airport in a bus that nearly cost us our lives with a dangerous driver on his phone all the time. I can not stress enough do not use this Hotel and believe me this is brief total waste of money.😡"

In the main restaurant there is no eye-catching, totally chaotic the table clearing/uncovering, food was not written to - ALLERGERS have the total look. The manager does not take care of the hotel areas at all, neither does they control them. After contact, the guest gets the impression that the guest is annoying!  The manager is also not receptive to small suggestions for improvement. Wi-Fi only in lobby area. The dishes are broken off - you can get injured here- is nevertheless offered to the guest every day again.  Even with a hotel that has become old, you can maintain the standard with daily checks, which has not been the case here for years.  It was only during an announced visit from the management level that the guests were able to experience the hustle and bustle of the day before. Since everything was then acutely cleaned on high polish, trimmed, swept, cleaned, covered, fixed - I would suggest to the hotel management times incognito check in there 2 days, then you can see it directly that the pretended quality is just sham! My rating: Don't go to this hotel, because you can spend your saved holiday money better elsewhere where quality is right!"

        "review_text": "We stayed here for 10 nights October 2024, the hotel is absolutely beautiful! Rooms are big with loads of storage and a beautiful balcony view!! The hotel has 2 pools & a kids pool, a spa, 2 bars and loads of activities included with the all inclusive. Such as football, volleyball, beach volleyball, darts, ping pong, pool, archery. People work on the beach directly outside for jet skis, boat trips and the hotel can organise excursions, we did quad biking and camel riding. The hotel is about 15 minute drive from Madhia city which is an absolutely gorgeous place. We also ate out 3/4 times and all nearby restaurants are amazing. The food in and out of the hotel was all beautiful, there’s loads of option and is served beautifully. The drinks menu in the hotel is slightly limited however they have most alcoholic drinks/ soft drinks. I definitely recommend asking the hotels photographer (they have 2) to take pictures and print them, we did and ours are beautiful. There isn’t an ATM at the hotel but one about 15 mins walk, however you can change currency in the hotel. There’s also 2 shops which have literally everything you could need on holiday! We had a shuttle transfer and it took about 31/2 hours so I do recommend getting a private transfer to save time. Other than the long transfer i cant say anything bad about this hotel, it’s absolutely beautiful with lovely people, good food and in a good location in Madhia. Will definitely be back next year!!"

When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised we had a suite which was unexpected but a nice surprise. Room was lovely sea view couldn't have asked for more. The hotel was spotless the staff were friendly and helpful. The food well as a fussy eater myself I still managed to eat something everytime .The waiters were great cleaned tables very quickly fresh water on table at every meal. Would I go again yes but fly into a closer airport."

        "review_text": "The room was old, spoiled, with stained carpeting where you were afraid to walk barefoot on it (foot fungus). AC condensation dripped on carpet. There was initially no safe, which was then brought in afterwards and simply placed on the shelf of the wardrobe, brief briefing, that was it.  The food for breakfast & dinner was below average. Unlovingly presented and manufactured. Scoop dishes such as ragouts or goulash with bones on the meat, food, vegetables and side dishes were pushed cold from the kitchen (not hygienic with HACCP, food must be heated to at least 65°C, also in Tunisia) and only warmed in the edition !!!!. Every morning we had the same white bread, we had different in Tunisia. There wasn't even toast. For an omelette you had to wait in line for 20 minutes. The worst part was the placemats, disgusting. Absolutely unhygienic, dirty, because in the plastic net still the remains of the predecessor. From Friday to Sunday, the hotel was packed with locals, where we don't mind in principle, but the eating habits just made us shake our heads and feel uncomfortable. The food selection and preparation was also underground on those days. Hotel has a top location, beach, loungers and umbrella good. Pool is in need of renovation. Annimation not with passion. All in all a total bust, except top location and beach"

When we called the front desk, they checked twice looking in the room, instead of just apologizing. Not at all professional.  Few choices for dinner and breakfast. The spa pool was not clean. As for the view, it was very disappointing because of the outdoor pool, completely empty, when the weather was nice and we could have enjoyed it.  How can a 5-star hotel accommodate its guests with an empty pool, especially when it’s supposed to be the highlight of the property? The whole experiment was ruined.  Frankly, either you are a real 5-star hotel and you rise to the occasion, or you assume a 4- or 3-star rating. I don’t know who awards the stars in Tunisia, but clearly it’s not justified here.  We left very disappointed. One thing is certain: we will not come back."

A special word for Chief Concierge, Mr. Hatem, precise and efficient. But there's one but: we don't sleep well. The mattress is incredibly hard, which is very surprising in a five-star hotel. In the early morning, we're ground and broken.  Another point: in the thermal pool, there is no ramp to descend into the basin. Since the water is cloudy because of mineral salts, we descend to the judge on rather slippery steps, which is not at all ideal. In the end, despite the beauty of the site and the kindness of the staff, a second stay is not at all certain."

When we arrive no bottle of water in the room. At the restaurant for dinner, no olive oil and a rude waiter shouting in front of everyone: \"I ALREADY TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO OLIVE OIL!\" (the butler did what was necessary, sent him away and finally brought olive oil... In short, the hotel's amenities are not worth the room price at all, especially in this low season, when there are outlets that are closed, reduced staff but not at all well managed...."

The food is very good and the buffets are varied. The facilities are superb: swimming pools, spa, tennis...  We loved the quiet of this hotel but also the possibility to visit the cities of Tunis, Carthage, Sidi Boussaïd... located about 1 hour by car, to see!  The hotel also offers a 2h boat tour to get to the hot springs which we loved, the scenery is really beautiful and the sailors very friendly! I highly recommend this hotel for a perfect stay in Tunisia! Absolutely nothing wrong, everything was there and our expectations were more than met!

We had 1 room garden view finally if we can say a vacant lot with excavator and piles of rubble.The restaurant at breakfast if you like stale bread, at lunch and dinner dishes that look like nothing without tastes and repetitive no worries and yet we are not difficult. The beach: not enough deckchairs and dirty. Swimming pool: logically no deckchair reservation but in the morning towels already installed so after 3 days without place you do the same thing. Bar: terrace too small for the number of people in the hotel. Hyper-sweet, untasteful, infectious cocktails. We didn't understand everything about this hotel, why a brand new padel court that must cost a small fortune that will serve very little instead of renovating the interiors and carpets???management is not making the right decisions and risks losing many customers if nothing is done to stay 4*  After all these criticisms, we salute the good humor, smiles and courage of all the staff: employees, cleaning lady, bartender, waiters at the bar and restaurant, receptionists, photographer (Fethi,Houssem,Karim,lorenzo...) Without them we would certainly have changed hotels.  I still have not understood the positive reviews and we are not on our 1st trip."

After collecting my food I came back to the same table was still not ready. So I sat and waited, and waited and ended up using my hands to eat! Waiter finally came over with cutlery. I was asked if I wanted a drink and I asked for cola zero..was abruptly told to go to the machine and get it…went to the drinks dispenser and there was no cola zero on tap.  I stayed in room 1439, room was dated, curtains were hanging down as part was detached from the rail. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Food in the hotel was good, I particularly liked the Tunisian food.  As a regular visitor to Tunisia and as an ex holiday rep working and living in Tunisia for 3 years I was surprised that the animation team never even bothered to say a simple “hi” to me in the week that I was there. Maybe if I was a single woman then I might have been worthy of some acknowledgment. Having said that, the animation team seemed to work hard  Restaurant staff weren’t particularly friendly towards me but one Maitre d’ was kind an acknowledged my birthday and even came to find me when I left. They had a cake for me which I thought was very kind.  Reception totally ignored me once when I went to enquire about a transfer. Went back later and Habib sorted it. Habib was friendly and professional. If I had a business I’d employ him.  Pool area was lovely and so was the beach.  It was my first time in Djerba. Personally, I prefer Sousse and Port El Kantaoui"

        "review_text": "Let's start with the positive: The animation team was very friendly and the setting is great.  Small souvenir shop near the hotel with very attractive prices! As for the negative:  It was not until a seminary arrived that we had a buffet worthy of the name. No choice at the all-you-can-eat buffet, no indication of the products offered, no fish, no local pastries, 2 local dishes that fight in a duel. No information on arrival regarding access to infrastructure (all inclusive/half board/free activities or not). We learned from being turned away at an activity/evening that it was only for members of the “Coralia Club” (we still don’t know what it is). Difference in treatment between all inclusive and half boarders and members of the Coralia Club. Restaurant and bar staff not at all pleasant (especially superiors). Difficult management of meals when there are people, tense flow at the level of dishes and service in the room (no glass, no water...).  The music is too loud by the pool and let’s not talk about the evening, we hear it in the rooms as if we were at the party.  Concerning the bedding much too hard (mattress / pillow). The broken shower curtain bar, it holds thanks to the sdb mirror. No air conditioning in the room just ventilation... No poolside bar or even a snack if a small dip is made in the afternoon (winter period apparently).  Regarding their wellness area, for the installation of polish, it is done as follows: we paint the nail as well as the entire finger then remove the surplus with a piece of wood. As for the massage, it was just a layer of oil that I was brushed with for 1 hour.  Anyway, once not twice."

        "review_text": "We stayed in this establishment for a week, after the 3rd day we had to change rooms because too much problem in the 1st (778). The rooms are very poorly insulated, you can hear all the noises of the rooms next door especially the resonance of the hallway and the doors slammed. The infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. Unheated swimming pool, broken deckchairs, rusty table outside. Then for the unlimited buffet it's always the same, after a while it's tiring so at our own expense we left the establishment to eat in the restaurants that are next door (Gaia and the restaurant at the port of aghir). For the activities offered by the people of the central corridor it is a little expensive for what it is but the accompaniments are adorable. If you want to change your currency at the hotel, they only take cash and not with the CB. We had to find a vending machine because they told us to do it at the airport when we arrived but we arrived at 21:30, so everything was closed. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. The spa is suitable but poorly maintained. In fact the hotel is not a 4* but rather a 2* with sea views. Do not rely on photos especially the rooms because you will not have all the services indicated on the photos. This hotel has a big potential but really misused. We will not return to this property.

He showed professionalism from beginning to end and accompanied us throughout the stay. All the excursions were done with him and everything went very well. Thanks to him we had very nice taxis and who knew the history of the island well. I wanted to thank him for his kindness since even when we had problems (with our rental car) he was there to help us and follow us he was really our protector during this trip.  I therefore also recommend this 1000% guide.  Thanks again for everything.  Line and Fatma"

From belly dancing half naked to people openly drinking alcohol it is frankly disgusting,  all is very uncomfortable. The animation people should be showing more Islam than not. The place is sub par and the service is unfaltered. The culture night which is every Thursday, if you are Muslim do NOT go. Haram everywhere.  All in all partially enjoyable as I met some good Algerian Muslim brothers and good people who where staying here."

        "review_text": "The hotel is highly recommended for its facilities, spectacular breakfast and beautiful beach which is practically in the garden. What you have to make sure if you book x mail is that when they answer that your reservation is confirmed, that the signatory puts their name and charge in the hotel. It happened that we arrived and our reservation had never been entered. I had all the emails I sent and they replied confirming my reservation but did not take them into account. Finally after a very bad time and several comings and goings with Fatma (manager who arrived later) sent our friendly couple to another hotel (which was higher category and whose difference they wanted to charge!) and we were able to stay there in the only room left available.  I have to admit that the manager who was that night and another gentleman whose names I don’t remember were extremely kind to us but I can’t say the same about Fatma, who can be very good at running a hotel but not for public relations with guests (her manners and shouts leave quite a lot to be desired). A little anecdote: as a gentleman for the bad time we were given dinner that night. They give us the menus and suddenly we see coming almost running to Fatma who looks at the maitre as an indication and he practically rips the cards from our hands, to give us another very poor one that had only a menu option. We feel totally untreated and humiliated!! If this unfortunate fact had not happened I could say that the hotel deserves five stars and obviously we will return!!!"

Turning to the environment, it is very suggestive: it is a typical Tunisian house with decorated tiles and traditional furnishings.

Lovely tiles and courtyard- look at the pictures, exellent staff who speak good English and are very helpful and genuinely nice. There is a great rooftop and a guest kitchen which is helpful to have (though not well equipped or used.   It is a hostel though, so its basic. The rooms are around a coatyard so it can get noisy- my friend had a crying baby in room next door which made it hard to sleep.  Internet is patchy. And weirdly in such a coffee drinking country the breakfast (otherwise good) had instant coffee which is frustrating....I hate instant coffee!  But the real deal is that it is the only cheap hotel in the Medina, the local area is friendly and untouristy, and if you stay there you are immersed in real old Tunis which is worth a lot in my book."

We were there in early July and the heat was what one might expect in Tunisia at that time of year: HOT!  Dar Ya was a really great experience.   Our room was on the first floor, and there was no AC. This traditional style Tunisian home had no windows to the outside so we relied heavily on the fan in our room. I had also brought a small personal fan which I'd recommend. There was another group of 10 teenagers and leaders staying there at the same time, and they had 2 rooms upstairs, one with an AC unit.   There were two showers, two sinks, and about 5 toilets which were shared with the other first floor guests.  They were cleaned each morning and everything was well-maintained.   The morning breakfast was really great and offered hard boiled eggs, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, pastries, yogurt, coffee and tea served on beautiful Tunisian pottery. The staff are so accommodating and when the gentleman who set up the daily breakfast realized we had an early flight, he made sure we had coffee and pastries.   As someone else stated, the lighting in our room was rather dim, but we made it work. Also, WiFi was available for free, but rather weak. I'd definitely stay there again. It was a great location and felt very safe."

The owner (I think) doesn't speak English and my grade 8 French is weak to say the least, was so nice as well.

A performance hall has been reopened after 3 years of closure to make guests feel more comfortable. The bar and bartenders are excellent, local alcohol, cocktails there is everything. Bukhatine (mixture of bukha and cedratine) show with fiery bar etc... The chef bartenders also prepared us special cocktails super good: one in coffee another in chocolate and the last lemon mint banana: a delight   The team that looked after the children is also of high quality.

The Abreu Agency did not tell me that the journey from the airport/hotel took 1 hour, with 7 stops in different hotels. A 2:30h trip leaving Lisbon took one night, including check-in and return will be the same. The Palm Azur Hotel is not recommended for children. The air conditioning only works from June. Another failure of the Abreu Agency because temperatures of 37 degrees were recorded."

The animators are hyper dynamic and always try to please us.  Regarding the restaurant part it was perfect. Very varied and very good food. Not necessarily just Tunisian dishes.  A huge thank you to Farid who allowed us to spend an exceptional anniversary evening that we will not soon forget. A man of great heart and care.  There will still be 2 small downsides: evening entertainment stopped way too early, probably because we were not in high season, and then the Quad exit proposed to the hotel which will have been disappointing because we will have only made road and an unnecessary stop of 15 min for je ne sais quoi. It would have been better to warn us that it was mostly a walk which would have been less frustrating for some of us who wanted a little sensations on beautiful tracks.  Mahmoud listened to us and made us beautiful proposals for our stay to be most pleasant. Thanks also to Faten who advised us well for the visits. With a heavy heart we went back on the road but full of emotions and memories."

He is a walking volcano of energy, he is everywhere, always smiling and very helpful. He will calm you down during morning yoga and stretching sessions or while playing mini golf and will give you a good workout during a game of beach volleyball or aqua fitness. What the whole team of Animators does in the evening is a real bomb! They can liven up and get literally everyone dancing! Great dancers, energetic, full of passion, spontaneous. It is wonderful to watch them. Energy, energy and more energy! The food is delicious, varied and the restaurant staff is very nice and smiling. The rooms are clean, spacious and atmospheric.

The hotel was clean and tidy, the food was plentiful with a good choice on most days, and the beach was just at the foot of the hotel.  A special watch out for the spa, we experienced massages by a lady who was clearly not trained, and therefore had bruises for the next two days - this is a bit we would miss out when we visit again.  The room was cleaned everyday without fail, and the service is impeccable.  The reason why we have given it 4 out of five stars is just the few things that were lacking - no chips in sight all week (which is survival food for an all inclusive), the a la carte restaurant didn’t have a menu, or take any dietary requirements into consideration or offer alternatives, a huge deposit needed for an iron, a kettle in the room but no tea making facilities, and all-inclusive hotel, but no drinks in the fridge, these small things would have made our trip exceptional.  Our highlight was absolutely the entertainment team who were excellent, every day there was heaps of activities around the pool and the evening entertainment kept us busy!   A special shout out to Zizu, Mimo and Jamie who added that extra touch of ‘special’ and kept the smiles coming all day - thank you all, you topped our holiday and we can’t wait to re-visit - mainly because of you!"

        "review_text": "Just about to leave from a week at Sidi Mansour. We got a very cheap deal so our expectations were not too high but have to say, was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is a little tired and the rooms are very basic (no kettle!!) but everything was very clean. The pool area is fabulous and quite picturesque and seeing as most days were spent around the pool for us, this was a big plus.  The food isn’t amazing but we did manage to eat at every meal with no major issues. The salads are amazing! The waiters and bar staff  are all very pleasant and eager to fill up your wine glasses at every opportunity 😂 Now onto the entertainment team. Our holiday would simply not have been the same if it hadn’t been for the efforts from this amazing young team. They work tirelessly from morning until early hours and always have a smile on their faces. They obviously are asking people to get involved in their activities but I would never have said that they ‘pestered’. I generally didn’t join in with a lot of the activities but would get asked and as soon as I said no, they left me alone. I really can’t stress how much they made our holiday. All of the team were amazing but a special mention for Tweety, Inzo and Chris ( not their real names) 😂 who really went above and beyond to bring enjoyment to our days!  All in all, a fabulous mixture of relaxed and activity filled holiday, met some great people and would definitely return for the cost!"

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is a little tired, in need of refurbishment. The rooms are basic and somewhat dated but clean and comfortable. We had paid for a garden view room but the manager upgraded us to a pool/sea view room on the day we arrived which was great until we realised we were above the bar so it was quite noisy at night - and first thing in the morning when the cleaners started work!  Food in the restaurant is ok - not the best for my British taste (no cereal at breakfast for example) but it’s varied so there was always something I could find to enjoy.   All the staff are friendly and welcoming, from the bar staff, waiters,  reception and  cleaners.   This holiday was nowhere near perfect but, for the price we paid, was really good value for money. There’s not a lot to do outside of the hotel but we’d only come for a week in the sun and the weather was perfect for sunbathing round the pool - which is immaculately clean and a lovely space to relax in. The music can be quite loud, except between 12 and 3, but we enjoyed it although others didn’t.   What made this holiday great for us was the animation team - they work really hard to include as many guests as possible in the games from first thing in the morning until last thing at night. They are all characters and are friendly to everyone. A special mention has to go to Criss, Inzo, Abdul, Mario, Nutella and Steve - what a team!  We had particular fun with the newest members of the team, Tweety, who wore some outrageous fancy dress costumes every day and made us laugh with his antics. His name should be Cheeky because he’s certainly that!  The hotel would not be the same without this team of young people working hard to make the guests time enjoyable. Thank you guys.   All in all, we had a lovely holiday. You know the saying ‘you get what you pay for’ and we didn’t have high expectations for what the holiday cost - but our expectations were exceeded, by the friendliness of everyone at the hotel and, despite its shortcomings, I would recommend this as a destination."

        "review_text": "The hotel is in need of some refurbishment but the rooms were clean and serviceable. On the whole the food was acceptable but not very varied however there was always something acceptable to eat. On the subject of the animation team !................ loud, intrusive and seemingly unable to take no for an answer, repetitive loud music around the pool area, constant harassment to join in the \"fun\", impossible to enjoy a quiet drink in the bar at night. On the subject of the beach - it is reached by walking down a road alongside a wall topped with broken glass, little strewn with thousands of empty plastic bottle scattered around along with other indescribable bags of stinking rubbish! Not forgetting the homeless encampments along the way. The area around the beach can only be described as a \"bombsite\" devoid of vegetation and appeared to have been used as a dumping ground for unwanted rubbish. On my visit I encountered a discarded settee, two microwaves and various items of broken furniture, The bar at the Beach is NOT all inclusive and only soft drinks are provided - alcohol is payable. Overall I understand you get what you pay for but the surrounds of the hotel do not inspire. Very few British people in the hotel and all feeling somewhat disillusioned. On a more positive note the bartenders in the Hotel provided excellent customer service and could not be faulted. If you want a holiday where you remain within the hotel around the pool and like to participate in repetative activities and the same in the bar in the evenings then this is the hotel for you if on a budget - otherwise STAY WELL CLEAR."

        "review_text": "My mum and I stayed at this hotel for a week in May and, despite being a bit rough around the edges, we had a great time and would definitely return.  Depending on when you go, there are not many English people in the hotel. This wasn't an issue for us at all and was something we were aware of because we had researched the hotel before booking. Every guest we met was lovely and we had no problems. If you want a hotel that is full of English people then this probably isn't the one for you.   We originally booked this hotel based on the reviews of the animation team, and they didn't disappoint. The whole team work incredibly hard both day and night to make sure everyone has fun, I didn't find them to be too pushy. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and were the highlight of our holiday.  The food was great while we were there. Although there is a small selection at each meal and sometimes it can feel repetitive, the actual quality of the food that was there was great and I never had a single meal that I didn't enjoy. There was always some form of rice and potato on offer so I think even fussy eaters would be fine. The drinks are ok, although there is limited choice in the main restaurant which is a shame.  There were a few small things that weren't perfect, we experienced water outages twice in the week we there, we had a tile fall off of our bath and often our 'clean' bath towels were stained and discoloured. You also have to pay a deposit to get towels for the pool and for a safe in the room, but this is not a massive issue. The beach wasn't the best, but we spent most of our time around the pool anyway. We weren't given any information when we checked in which is an area I think needs to be improved.   Overall, for the price paid, it was more than worth it. Good rooms, good service, great entertainment."

They tried,   shibo was not at all  friendly ,miserable he Did not mingle with the guests  he couldn't even say hello, The hotel was full of different nationals and  very little English people and it's of my opinion we was not made welcome like others, the animation team are certainly obsessed with been loud and dancing. They ruined my experience.  The hotel is in need of some updating inside and out, food ok, rooms good pool clean sunbeds need replacing , most are broken and uncomfortable.  Nothing to do in the area very quite."

Two members of  Animation team were just awful, The assistant manager Shibo , he was so rude no costumers skills what so ever. when I asked him why only two English songs were played all evening He shouted and me in front of guests and other Animation team employers AND SAID SO WHAT!!!when I said your attitude is not acceptable he said go and report me. I told his Manager but is behaviour did not improve, in fact when the manager was not there he did not play any English music. I saw  him been horrible to other animation team members.   For the whole of our two weeks stay the evening  entertainment consisted of Dancing and more dancing, we had a hour karaoke, two fakir shows ,30 mins bingo/tombola and quiz, we were badgered into buying tombola/ bingo tickets by the animation partially  Nutella when I said we didn't want  to buy some tickets we don't play bingo she said don't you like the Animation team!!!! and would not speak to us again.  The Arabic music played around the pool and  on the Evening was that loud you couldn't hear your self think, we was been hassled constantly to dance and  join in activities we found that a bit difficult when we was not familiar with the music , sorry the two English songs played every night was free from desire, And the twist!!! They think been loud is important!!! Bar staff/ other staff reception staff were nice. Manager of the hotel was nice . would I return Never."

        "review_text": "Djerba is already a very dirty island. The hotel is clean in appearance, hygiene etc but not at all. At first the food seems correct. There were five of us, and two out of five sick! One of the two on infusion!!! Produced to make the fruits fat, it seems or tourista. 30% of the hotel was sick but the doctor said there was no sick. Bizarre.. Do not take ice cubes, apricots, melon, watermelons. Eat only cooked and dry products. Make sure your water bottles are closed. Rinse it with bottle water.  Poor cleaning.  On the other hand infirmary and doctor at the top on site and fortunately! But then take out the blue card... any plan to make money? Getting people sick? Well, I'm not speculating either.  The shop is expensive, thieves. Do not buy at this location.  Excursions took place on the beach.  I advise the Saharan very well. The pirate ship is fine.   Animation-wise, the Djerbians are very strong and kind but it’s only trade! Watch out for your daughters or even your wives because Arna-COEUR! I offer you a gift, I charm you and arrived in France my Big Daughter was receiving messages and she almost got fooled and even my wife who had left her whatsapp.   The animations are good but its young people are exploited no wonder they manipulate. On the spot he doesn't know anything about my daughter and luckily, I think so. In short, appearance and if one does not get seriously ill ok. Otherwise choose a better destination and plan antidiuretics!   On the other hand a positive for the massages, and the staff there, except for the many grazers.  Long live the visa.  BGG, a family man."

        "review_text": "First the view is really great and also the staff very nice. However, the ladies and the elderly gentleman at the reception very unfriendly. The hotel is said to have 5 stars, which we find absolutely exaggerated. You had to balance your bags yourself from the car to the hotel and from the room up the stairs back to the reception. Sorry, but you can't do that. Breakfast is a joke for a 5 star hotel. A cappuccino or a few scrambled eggs, omelette or similar costs everything extra here. We didn't try the dinner. Hence no statement on that. The rooms are nice in themselves but so noisy that you could hear doors slamming especially in the morning as people ran up and down the stairs or the staff swept the pool area in the morning. Unfortunately, it has come of age. After one of the rooms was converted into a construction site one afternoon, my collar burst. But so be it! Conclusion a hotel that really and honestly did not deserve the 5 stars at all. Great location doesn't give me 5 stars yet, there is more to it. There are 4 star hotels in Sidi that are better and I mean no harm. Ah so the reception manager was super nice and extremely helpful, but even he can't change anything if the owners let it slide like that. What a shame!"

We stayed 4 nights - excited for the location and upgraded to their top suite. Unfortunately, we ran into problems almost every day. 2 of the 4 nights our AC did not blow cold air - in 40C weather. Woke up completely drenched in the middle of the night. They kept sending someone to “fix” it but nothing changed. Several arguments, 5 calls to the front desk, and 3 days later, they finally believed us and sent a real HVAC tech to fix the problem. The last day/night an electric problem caused all of our outlets to stop working in the room. The towel warmer shocked us. On top of it all, the hot water stopped working. We’re usually easy travelers and aren’t phased by minor discomforts. But for the amount of money paid ($400USD/night) and this being a 5 star hotel - it was totally unacceptable. The hotel manager spoke to us at check-out and proceeded to give us a lecture on how the AC works (even though there was clearly an issue and they sent an HVAC tech from the nearby town to fix it and admitted there was an issue). She grudgingly ended up giving us 10% off our bill and promised us a discount at our next stay. Sorry, this will be the first and LAST time we stay here!"

        "review_text": "We booked the family suite at La Villa Bleue, but our experience fell far short of the expectations of a Five Star Pension.   Cleanliness and condition of the room: When we arrived, the sheets and towels were dirty. We asked that they be changed, but those provided to us were also stained. The bathroom was dilapidated and a strong smell of pipework persisted. The shower and sink were clogged, and the water stagnated at the ankles when we showered. Despite our complaints, the maintenance failed to resolve the problem, informing us that it would not be repaired until after our Check-out. No other rooms have been offered   Service: The behaviour of the female manager was unacceptable. When I wanted to borrow a book from the living room library to read in the bedroom, she ripped it out of my daughter’s hands saying that books should only be consulted in the living room. I have never seen this in my life after years of traveling. A vulgar and haughty behavior, this person has nothing to do in the hotel industry and has no sense of customer service. I remain shocked by this lack of professionalism and respect.   In contrast, the rest of the staff, especially at breakfast, were friendly and helpful   In short, the establishment relies on its location and the view, but forgets that a Five Star Pension must offer a standard that lives up to its claims. The performance is far from the Award paid. I will never return and do not recommend this property"

You cannot beat the views on their terraces (the breakfast area and the pool area)..  The breakfast area terrace has an unobstructed view of the Mediterranean.   Access to cars: Even if it’s in the pedestrian area, cars have access to pick you up or drop you off at the hotel entrance. However, expect to pay a higher fare, given that you’d have to ask the hotel to call a taxi for you, or, that most Bolt, InDrive transfer app drivers try to avoid driving through the pedestrian area. You can walk through the pedestrian area yourself (a 10min stroll), but not with suitcases (streets in the pedestrian zone are cobbled and can be slippery).   Rooms: There are a few rundown rooms and a few that are not sea view. My advice is to aim for a sea view room that’s been renovated/well-maintained (if you’re staying there, might as well pay extra and enjoy the sea view off your windows, balcony or terrace). Do not count on getting good Wi-Fi inside some of the rooms (depending on the location of your room). But the rooms have safes, are spacious and are clean.   Staff: Wonderful staff! They carry a positive attitude and are more than ready to help with any question or request you have.   Lubna and Reem (at the reception) excel at providing the best service possible. Kareema and Hamza (breakfast area) carry a cheerful attitude while providing a great service at breakfast. Mariam and Afaf (house-keeping) work nonstop at making sure everything is spick-and-span. The whole crew take their work seriously and always carry a smile on their faces and a can-do attitude."

Not much for breakfast but freshly made omelette and eggs were nice.  Got very busy at meals times so queue likely at busy periods. Not much beach. As the sea is always in. Not ideal to swim in.

Me who would have liked to do some windsurfing or other as stipulated in the description, (non-existent)! The food 🤩 the buffets at the top, great. The rooms \"old\" but functional, except TV, light at least, and shower that \"leaks\" (it's old, and electricity and maintenance is expensive).  Everywhere is clean. If you can take the sea view it is much better.  The staff, a big good point, they and they are very friendly to our dedicated little care 👍 Thanks for everything. And happy holidays to others."

        "review_text": "In second place to the beautiful Midoun beach, the hotel keeps the promises of its site. Spacious enough rooms, elegant common areas, large swimming pools and flower gardens, good quality cuisine and very helpful and competent staff make it a very pleasant place for a relaxing holiday, or a more lively family stay. A special mention for maintenance staff, who spend their days cleaning and tidying up the premises. The weak point is undoubtedly the small thalasso center, where massages, otherwise correct, are not always as long as advertised, and the linen of the cabins obviously reused several times in a row! It’s probably better to go and get a massage outside, where there are many wellness centers. To be sure to be quiet, ask for a room in the rear wing, away from the pools."

        "review_text": "Our stay at Hotel Le Ksar was very disappointing, despite a pleasant setting. Several points have greatly displeased us, to the point of questioning the 4 star rating of the property.  Catastrophic animation  Animation is non-existent and soulless. The animation team, apart from one or two people, is totally lacking in motivation and enthusiasm. The activities of the day are almost nil, except for a game of pétanque, and the evenings are of absolute sadness. The facilitators themselves seem to be uninterested, which makes no one want to participate at all. For a hotel in this category, this is unacceptable.  Very limited cleanliness despite a dedicated employee  As soon as we arrived, we were shocked by the state of the room, far from the expected standard. The cleanliness was poor, and this problem did not get better during the stay. However, we found that the maid was doing her best. She was overworked and had too little time to ensure effective cleaning. It is therefore not a lack of professionalism on his part, but a big problem of organization and resources.  A very average, even misleading All-Inclusive  The All-Inclusive service is very disappointing, especially in terms of drinks.  Alcoholic beverages appear to be cut with water, making them tasteless.  Difficulty finding glasses and cutlery repeatedly, which forces you to search or wait.  Low quality and choice for a hotel in this category.  Lack of general organisation  Recurrent problem with pool towels: often broken, forcing holidaymakers to wait or do without.  Often outdated staff: Some employees are helpful and do their best, but they are clearly understaffed.  Conclusion: a hotel to avoid  We already stayed in 3 star hotels in Djerba that were much better than Le Ksar. Between non-existent animation, insufficient cleanliness, very average All-Inclusive and a glaring lack of organization, we definitely do not recommend this property. It is far from the level expected for a 4 star."

The least... Service at the shabby restaurant. It is up to us to find the cutlery and glasses, the tables are never laid. No bottle of water in the restaurant or in the rooms, we have to fill a decanter with water and find an empty bottle and fill it If you wish to have some in the room. The staff is not very welcoming, complicated to have a smile, except the housekeeping staff, it really feels like others are suffering their day. The cleaning of the rooms is very succinct, claim toilet paper, shower gel is not accessible. All inclusive is very limited to soft drinks, and beer. Coke whisky pays as does gin. The animation team is totally non-existent, no animation during the day, except to come to you to ask you when you arrived and when you leave, that's all! We have been coming to Djerba for ten years twice a year. This is the first and last time we will stay in this hotel which is far from deserving of these four stars.  We don't know if there are any officials in this structure, but if they exist it's time to set the bar straight, you're definitely not up to the other establishments."

At the level of activities, Manssour came directly to us as soon as we arrived to offer us full of activities, the price remains reasonable and negotiable , always with a smile. For our part, we did the carriage ride from 9am until 1.30pm, very nice it was great we saw lots of things, we also did quad biking and really it was top!! And we also cameled by the sea and in Berber villages for 2 hours. The + in all this is that Manssour always made sure that we were okay during the activities and especially after , to make sure that we had a good time which was the case. At the catering level, it was excellent, the kitchen staff was really friendly, the only small flaw is that there were often the same things to eat. I recommend this hotel for your holidays you will be extremely happy with your stay!!!"

If you come here as a woman alone, in my case as a woman with a son, you are truly despised here. The first experience in the restaurant, I ask the waiter very kindly if I can order something, he turns aggressively around 'I'm not a machine, you're going to wait!\" In commanding tones. I thought, first experience with the hotel, could be better. I ask for a glass of wine, and put a half full bottle of lukewarm white wine in front of me.... The pictures don't really reflect the actual atmosphere (rather marginally), the food is very limited (not very healthy) and wine is offered in cardboard espresso cups. Had asked in advance to be able to reserve massages or early or later in the day it was all possible, but now arrived everything is full outside in the middle of the afternoon or afternoon.... Fitness is very limited and then paying for this. The drinks menu is very limited. I don't recommend it"

The animation team is sooooo great, they try so hard. Always laughing even though they have such a long day. Childcare from the hotel is just fantastic. Ama and the other two are just worth gold. We will definitely come back and are already looking forward. The beach is a dream, like in the Caribbean. This time we stayed in the main house, the rooms could have been a tick cleaner. But that's just as a side note.  Also positive to mention is the German guest care of Sadok, mega friendly.  On the beach there are excursions, jet skis, camel rides etc., you can accept this really easily. All very friendly and non-intrusive. Moreover, cheaper than the German travel providers. I have done 2 trips and parasailing so far. All top of the line and really cheap. Price performance top. Distance from the airport 45 to 50 minutes."

He was unprofessional, nor did he have the attitude neither the look of guest reception. The room was dirty, I had to change it ( I found dirty sheets and hair on the bed) the 2nd room was also dirty. The room had AC but they turned it off, the same rude guy from the reception was telling guests that the season for AC has not started when it was very hot and humid in there. They also activate the keycard for 48h then you have to go ask them to reactivate it again. They said the system had a problem but I guess they were doing it on purpose to make people go to the reception just in case. The room service was not on a daily basis and the breakfast was terrible. I’ll never go back."

After complaint, kindly offered us another room on the 1st (423) nothing to say except for the bathroom same remarks as that on the ground floor. Unpleasant on Friday we did not redo the room..on Monday at 5am the reception that wakes us up telling us that our shuttle to the airport was waiting for us, while we only left on Tuesday around 1.30pm.. not very nice all this.  I made these inconveniences to the director, who was sorry and apologized."

The food is fine.  The service at the reception is very nice and always at pains.  Otherwise, there is actually no service here. It's self-service everywhere.   The beach is very nice, apart from the sad horses and camels that are exploited here. They stand all day in the blazing sun to entertain the tourists.  It would definitely have to renovate the pool area as the floor looks and feels like the tiles have been removed and simply no new ones laid."

Very decent restaurant with home fries every day, at the request of one of our daughters, the chef to upset the schedule to make a cuckoo!!!! A week of holidays at the top but too short in this establishment that we will surely return to. Cedric, Virginia, Margaux and Romane"

        "review_text": "Started well with a wonderful welcome when we arrived at 11pm... dinner and cold beer waiting for us. This hotel is beautiful, immaculate setting, super clean and lovely pool and beach area. Definitely best All inc buffet I've had anywhere, and the beer and wine are lovely. I'm veggie and although always ate so well cghef and the manager offered to cook me anything else I needed. Can't fault it.    The hotel has the usual family entertainment, but guests who may want a busy nightlife will be able to get a cheap taxi to Sousse or Monastir. The Hotel location is in a peaceful area but an ideal base to explore. We particularly liked Monasastir for cafe life and history and shopping!  Bedrooms have a balcony and full bathroom, English TV channels, and fridge. Bring a bottle for free cold water refils. We had the best sleep. Super comfy beds and quiet rooms.   The staff are lovely, particularly bar staff, dining room staff and receptionists.   The outstanding joy of this hotel is Mr Jaleel the manager. He genuinely cares so much about guest satisfaction and will go out of his way to resolve any  issues. He gets so upset when people come home and complain when he would easily resolve issues if only told about them. He's a credit to his hotel and Country.   I can't wait to return  to this peaceful hotel with beautiful beach and great food. Thank you so much to everyone at The Neptunia"

The staff is very friendly, many speak German as well. The manager was present all day and always asked if everything was okay. And, as good food as there we didn't even have in 4* hotels ! The beach is just a dream and is cleaned several times daily. Although we never fly to a hotel more than once we have already booked for 2025. We can only recommend it. In addition, it is now to be renovated further over the winter."

After a year became insanely delicious food, the choice is small, but there were always fresh delicious fruits, very delicious sweets, fish, meat, mussels (in the hotel 3*:)) , side dishes, tortillas, we ate to the ground (bringing sausage😅 but it didn't come in handy😅)  Whiskey was taken, beer was drunk at the hotel, quite 👌🏻  The room stock is being renovated, the rooms are being renovated, yes, it's not a super suite, but everything is very, very clean and neat 🤷🏼‍’”️ The most luxurious sea view of the rooms  The beach this year was cleaned twice EVERY day, sifted through the sand early in the morning and afternoon, the seaweed was cleaned immediately   We're not quite lucky with the weather, but this item has nothing to do with the hotel😅  Met a lot of guests who were last year (what people are coming back says a lot, I believe)   If there are flights from Moscow, in September 2025😂 we will come again to our soulful nearest dacha😅"

        "review_text": "This was the 15th time I have been to Tunisia. This was my first time at this hotel.  Hotel is spotlessly clean. Maids cleaning from sun up to sun down. They should be paid more! The best advice I can give, tip well. You’ll be treated well.  Mr Jalel (manager) couldn’t do enough for us. I have walking problems and COPD. We had to move rooms a couple of times because I needed air con. Air con wasn’t working in either room. Mr Jalel ended up getting me a floor standing fan to help with the heat.  We were on the 2nd floor facing the sea. The breeze was needed.  Reception staff, especially Abdallah, were extremely helpful. Abdallah can speak good English and was very helpful when we needed a translator. I even ordered a birthday cake for my partner with the help from Abdallah.  Dining room and kitchen staff were also very nice and helped whenever I needed help.  We celebrated a birthday while at the hotel and they pulled out all the stops to make a cake and decorate the table with fresh flowers. All the staff even sang happy birthday. They were amazing!  There is only one downside to this hotel and it was an employee called Adel who took you on excursions in the hotels name to wherever you wanted to go.  We thought he was very friendly. He sold jewellery at the side of the shop and also worked in the shop with the shopkeeper at times. He even took us to atm when we needed to change money. He took us to the medina in Sousse and showed us around. He took us to a rug making shop. We enjoyed the banter from the staff at the shop and Adel. We bought 2 rugs! We brought one rug home with us and paid for the other to be shipped to Scotland. This rug was more expensive as it was a gift for mother in law, who is 85. We wanted a family tree with the names of the family in Arabic.  We have asked Adel 4 times since our return to Scotland regarding when we would receive the rug. We were told to start with that we would get it. Now we don’t even get a reply about the rug."

Explore outside of the hotel, great nightclub and shopping in monastir, shopping, clubbing and Arabian night in sousse where great. Late night beach parties were also great.

        "review_text": "This hotel is optimised for mass tourism and provides a pretty sterile experience for any traveller who wants to get some experience and a feel for local communities. It is a “resort”, quite isolated about 10 km from Tunis  and surrounded by other, mostly now abandoned, tourist venues of similar stripe. The nearest store is a 25 minute walk away.  Although the staff were very pleasant people, I don’t think the hotel deserves a 5 star label as it displays little by way of hospitality beyond a bed - not even a bottle of water in the room. The buffet is large but ordinary, and it’s wise not to wait too long after start time. I didn’t get to try the sparsely patronised a la carte presto, but the bar was quite good, though understaffed.  I stayed here due to it being part of a package tour, but I would not choose the place if organising my own travel arrangements."

MAIS: - no tourist information available at the reception  - Rooms at the end of their life: holes in the carpet, phone and hair dryer that do not work, fairly dubious cleanliness, worn paint, window that can be opened but not closed...) - if you want to have breakfast near the dining room window, you can be turned away because the tables are large and there are only 2, 3 or 4. - seminar in the lobby and on the pool for 2 days: lots of noise  And the icing on the cake: - a swimming team that trains in the outdoor pool all day: howling, trumpets... and makes noise in the corridors at night.  In short, it is a good place, well placed (away from Tunis but close to other places to visit) but do not seek luxury and calm."

In addition, after each intervention, a small SMS to know if the request was made and always a reminder about their availability.  The hotel is very nice the lobby, the amazing bar with live music, there is really a beautiful work on the aesthetic of bar that reminds me a little of the American jazz club.   The restaurant is a self, it's varied there is everything. But it remains a self, clean, after it often lacks serving cutlery in sauces or other accompaniments. I didn't see if there was an à la carte restaurant, what was already enough for me. And again it was clean. The orange juice in the morning was troooop good!!!   Our twin double room with white decoration, a very spacious balcony and a view of the entire hotel with the sea in the background, so I think we had one of the best locations for visibility.   And to finish the best for last, my little relaxing moment at the beautician, where I was lucky to be in 2 pairs of good hands with Najla and Dhouha who took care of me perfectly, I extremely needed a manicure and a pedicure, which was executed without any worries, with incredible kindness, in addition to the professionalism found in the execution of my treatments... we chatted a little and again it is always nice to have people smiling and who have a sense of welcome."

But on the other hand, don’t think to check if the housekeepers hand over water knowing that we are in tt included , clever trick for us to serve the mini bar , medium technique , to go and ask our due to the reception for WATER.   The restaurant has a varied choice at every meal, what’s great is that employees at the end of the shift can serve this which limits waste and at least they work on a full stomach.   Which is to be thrown up. It is to see them serving in the middle of duty in the gastro with their fingers , eating in front of the customer , then serving you with a \"pliers\" , and all this in the greatest calm the chefs of room say nothing , it is moon , eat ok = this make a plate and go in the kitchen is better.

On the other hand wait 2h for extra pillows after 5 calls at reception I found it completely move!  I want to mention a special note to Najla at the beauty area for her services that made our stay so much more enjoyable 🙏 we tested, hairstyle, radiance facial and beauty feet. She is caring, gentle, attentive! It's no one's love! I recommend 200%!!"

Several chefs will prepare different dishes for you, whether for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   The room is a bit old and deserves to be refreshed.  On the other hand it was very clean and quiet (because the balcony overlooked the pool and not the outside).   Little tour to the spa where I could enjoy a facial done by Najla that was really top.   Excellent value for money for this hotel, I recommend."

My husband is injured during a slide ride nobody par ali the gentleman who manages the excursions is taking care of us. Forced to go to the private clinic on a Sunday and pay a blind we also had to negotiate the price of 300 euros announced we went to 100 euros to get sewn under the chin. Our belongings also took a bleach for a housekeeper during a pool outing in the indoor pool. The manager offered me and my husband a 30 min massage. That's nice of him. The food is not extraordinary but we always find to please despite the recurrence of dishes. Their donuts and pancakes are excellent.  The hotel is clean and we made quite a few excursion with ali and garcia that really have us more. Despite the waste and stray cats... alive and dead if we ignore all its is a beautiful country that gives the impression of freedom."

Two examples: The desk agent placed a phone order for food for us, and had it delivered by the security agent, from the restaurant downstairs, on our first night, because we were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. On the day we left, at 3:30am because we had an early flight, the desk agent (different from the first one) came downstairs to check on us after he saw on the security cameras that we were waiting for our taxi! And we had barely been waiting 5 minutes! The three security agents at the door were always cheerful. They provided tips and recommendations that made our 3-day visit even more pleasant. The room was spacious and very clean. Shower, sink and toilet were clean and worked well. Wi-Fi was dependable and fast. The breakfast was copious and delicious. We chose this hotel for its central location and weren't disappointed: 10 - 15 minutes from the airport (depending on traffic...) 20 minutes from the Medina and 20 minutes from Sidi Bou Said. We found taxis within less than 10 minutes each time we left the hotel to visit the city We very highly recommend the Maia Hotel Suites hotel for anyone visiting Tunis.  If we ever come back to Tunis, we won't bother looking for a different hotel."

Nearby there are a good number of clubs and restaurants, the center of Tunis instead is 20 minutes by taxi. The room I was assigned was tiny, they will have been a 10 sq m plus the bathroom also small. The essential but decent quality furniture. More to review the insufficient lighting especially in the bathroom where perhaps, on the mirror is appreciated a better visibility for example when shaving. Nothing to say about cleaning, done well and thoroughly. There are no room services, for these you have to call Glovo and the like. The common areas are very nice and well maintained. Breakfast is served à la carte in a room also very nice and with a very kind staff. The offer, however, is definitely limited, it revolves around different versions of the same omelet, no desserts, honestly after a while fed up. Ultimately nothing to say about the hotel and staff that I can only speak highly of. There would be little things that if put in place would make this structure really interesting. In the end, however, all in all I was fine."

Well furnished rooms, living room with two couches (one is a sofa bed) and a kitchenette, separate bedroom, dressing area with lots of shelves; a mini apartment!  We were expecting a continental breakfast and were surprised by a menu and waiters!  The evening front desk man who checked us in was amazingly hospitable and helpful. He arranged for someone to buy us a bottle of wine (the person had to take a taxi since there is no alcohol in that area of Tunis), brought us ice, and helped us order dinner to be delivered. The phone in the room didn't ring so he actually made three trips up to our room! Over and above.  Enthusiastically recommend this hotel which is a 10 minute, 10 dinar taxi ride to and from the airport."

        "review_text": "Maia Hotel is located in the Berges du Lac district close to Lac Leman and only a 10 minute drive from Tunis Carthage Airport.   There was a good welcome on arrival where there was a security check on the ground floor and then we took the lift to reception on 1st floor. Check-in was smooth and it wasn't long before we were given our key card for the suite that we booked.   The suite was spacious with an open plan kitchen/diner setup, large bedroom and bathroom. There was a lot of storage space. There were a few issues with the TVs and a lack of essential items provided in the kitchenette.   Breakfast was served in the restaurant, the menu was extensive and served to the table. A good range of hot and cold items were available and the coffee was excellent. It was a very good stay at Maia Hotel and ideal for an extended airport stopover."

Booking in was straightforward and not at all stressful. Shown to room without any delays.  Unfortunately we’re not given any information about hotel meal times or anything else.  Room. Clean and tidy and large enough for our needs. Large balcony. Bathroom had a shower over the bath. If you’re a short person may have trouble getting in and out. Only 2 sockets in room really do need more.  Room cleaned on a daily basis. Satisfied.  Restaurant. Food did vary only one soup available at mealtimes but plenty of salad. Food was more for the Eastern European guests. Brown bread was sometimes available but not always. Fruit and cakes plentiful. Good service and clean.  Bar. Good service and good staff. Drinks were the very cheap variety and sometimes ran out of some drinks. The bar area unfortunately wasn’t kept very clean. Quite often the tables were dirty and sticky. Did mention it to the bar manager but very little improvement.  Tea and snacks. Drink machines with paper/plastic cups. Morning snacks croissants, afternoon snacks cake. Bin for dirty cups was often dirty needed a good clean.  Animation. Very good. Entertainment room for improvement.  Pool area. Plenty of sun beds at all times and area kept clean.  Beach. Nothing to write home about, worst beach we have seen in over 50 holidays in Tunisia.  All in all a pleasant stay but could do better. Definitely not worth the 4 star rating more of a 3 star overall."

        "review_text": "Please don't waste your money by going to this place especially if you are traveling with children!!! This hotel was absolutely horrible. Before you pay for this hotel just know that you will be expected to pay about £50 before you get your keys!   We did not have hot water for 3 days and every time we said something, no-one took notice of what we were saying until we asked the manager to give us the rest of our money for the remaining 4 days so we could book another hotel, we even emailed love holiday who were helpful and refunded us a small portion of the monies we paid, once love holiday reached out to them they moved us to another room. Another problem was that their rooms were cold and the heating did not work properly, they gave us a small heater which helped a little, but this was very stressful especially when you have a 2 year old with you on holiday.  The heated pools were turned off, the spa was not open, the were no activities offered like advertised, we had to book a few excursions while we were there so that we wouldn't be sitting in the hotel room all day.  We found over 30 cigarettes buds on the children's play pit, it was absolutely disgusting because I toddler accidentally stepped on one and wanted to play with it, when I reported this to reception, they did seem to care.  The Hotel was filthy and never vacuumed, they only used broom on some areas.   The food was ok, not the best but okay, not a lot of variety especially for breakfast. They \"ran\" out of milk for 2 days so we could not have hot drinks or cereal.  The \"night entertainment\" was an absolute joke, it was just loud noise that they played until midnight, when we asked them to turn it down because we wanted to sleep, they obviously did not listen. Honestly if you advertise yourself as a family friendly hotel then surely you should try to be accommodating to people who will come to your hotel with children.  I loved the island of Djerba as a whole but this horrible hotel really ruined my holiday because it caused more stressed than relaxation."

        "review_text": "Omg where to start, we had booked a week at this hotel in March, it took 3 room changes to get a room that was remotely except able, even then a cleaner had to come in and clean it again, we missed lunch with room fiasco so asked where snack bar was and were told there was a cafe 1/2 a mile down road, tried to get a drink no beer no gin the list goes on. Thank god for some other guests who had some duty free and were happy to share. Food one option so no choice at evening meal so dried up chicken or nothing!!! Breakfast stale croissant not over cooked stale and the best bit you could have a cup of tea if you liked it black because no milk!!!! Everything is closed the indoor pool is not heated, you can’t even enjoy sitting on your balcony as furniture is filthy. We couldn’t stand being there anymore so we were checking out, another couple who arrived same day as us had booked flights home that’s how bad it is. Trying to check out was a nightmare they would not return our tourism tax which we had to pay in cash. We kept asking them to call a taxi but wouldn’t after 2 hours a taxi turned up for some other guest and the driver took us first as we were going round the corner. A cheap holiday should not mean that you can’t expect a clean safe environment or that if you are all inclusive you can’t get some edible food and a drink at the only open bar. As much as the few staff there were tried all they could say was sorry until we were checking out and this became quite hostile.  We are a well travelled couple and have had many cheap last minute getaways but never never have we expect anything like this, I don’t usually write reviews unless it’s a nice one, but I just feel I have to let people be informed of how bad somewhere is that you only stay one night a pay to go and stay somewhere else. In the summer maybe more of the hotel is open but unless some work is done it’s nowhere near a 4 star"

        "review_text": "This review could have easily been a 1 star. However, on reflection, the price we paid was only £34 a day all inclusive, which included the tax you paid on arrival at check-in.  The room was basic but a good size, which included a bath (need to ask for plug as not in room). On arrival, we were given a room with a toilet that didn't flush and a broken toilet seat, which were both resolved quickly.  It was out of season, and the room was cold, so I asked for a heater, which again was dealt with quickly. The food offer is very limited and is repetitive, with most days the hot counter offering food being luke warm in temperature. The bar on the afternoon of day three ran out of vodka and gin on the afternoon of day four with neither replaced until the evening of day five with only whisky and buka available for all inclusive guests even though they had spirits in another bar but were only available to paying guests. The gym has an additional charge and has very limited equipment in poor condition. Reception was very helpful in assisting any issues.  Most staff are polite enough, and the animation team tries to get to know you. It is located within walking distance of a few cafes / restaurants which we thought were good value for money, which was welcome due to food offer in hotel. The hotel is less than 1/2 a mile from the beach, which is not well maintained, and the two occasions we went were mainly occupied by camel rides. The hotel would appear to have been nice at one time, but it looks like lack of investment over time has taken its toll."

This music is played outside at the pool area and also the lower level of the hotel where the dining room is. There is no one ever at the pool, the animation guy playing it is the only one dancing.... it's pure self gratification. It's really an unbearable noise. If you want peace and quiet you will not get it here, not even by escaping to your room.  Food is mediocre, not at all hot, even when coming off the hot counter.  I'm here with my sister and we have been hassled a lot in the hotel. I expect it off site, but please not on the complex. I've been here two days and have been asked the same questions ten times over ie, what's my name, where am I from, have I been to Tunisia before.... please leave me alone on site. This is no way a four star, probably was once, but it's faded grandeur makes it now a two star at best. I would definitely not recommend, even for a cheapie break away."

Effectively beautiful room clean and beautiful view of the pool. But we were not informed of the noise of the evenings (music in depth until the first night 1:30 and the second the day before December 31 4:30) it is only the animators who dance. We were offered to change rooms, but based on feedback from the local holidaymakers, we preferred to keep ours and buy earplugs. Among other things, this hotel is a commercial hotel that complements with buses from Algeria and Libya that only come to eat and sleep 1 night. We had the worst Christmas Eve of our lives. People threw themselves on the food, there was not even a plate or tray. Our meal was for us a bit fries and with paid drinks. Great for an exclusive all.. While on some tables the food was spoiled (their habits do not justify everything) we went outside to finish our New Year s Eve. The restaurant, we are really tolerant people and not difficult, but there from the 1st day to the last day of our holiday it was always the same, it was good without more, not too many choices and the tablecloths are dirty. Do not hesitate to put a little more expensive and but a tip avoid this hotel.."

People at Reception and Restaurant didn't show any face yet.  They have a warm pool if you are here in winter months.  Rest of them are nothing like what they advertise in the site.  Start with Reception.  Such a laid back approach for everyone.  1 hour to check in. Couldn't check In, they gave us the keys to the room and asked us to come back later.  If you are dealing with one person means you will have to finish them before you move on to the next guest, where as here they hopping between three four people.  If you come from Europe then you'll be annoyed to see such a silly actions,  so as in the Restaurant guests have no courtesy stand in the queue,  easily jumping the ques and staff ignoring the ones who stood in the ques and encouraging que jumpers. Coming back to Reception.  Hidden cost of 260 Dinars as Tax, I Never heard such a high Tax for a week stay.  No WIFI IN THE ROOMS. WiFi only available in Reception area.  You need to speak French or Arabic if not Communications are really difficult with the staff in here. No body speaks English.  We were using Sign language.  Everyday we need ask the cleaner to provide gel, shampoo and Towels if not they don't top up Automatically.   HOT WATER ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE MORNING.  At the Restaurant,  most of the dishes were repeated . Never labelled food contents in English,  big struggle if you are vegetarian.  Fish weren't even scaled and Gutted properly before cooking.  Orange is the only fruit available for the whole week.  Hardly seen yogurt on the counter.  It's a  total disappointment.  Hotel needs demolition and re build from scratch get all the bad practices away,  if not Europeans please find somewhere else. It is not a 4 star Hotel. I Don't even give 1 star."

        "review_text": "I am staying at a hotel nearby. Their Spa is being renovated and I read about this hotel on Google reviews. I emailed them on Tuesday and Mohamed, the Spa manager emailed me back within the hour offering me an appointment for the Silver package I had read about for 350 TND for the following day. It was just fantastic. It included a 60 min massage, 30 min Hammam, 30 min jacuzzi bath with hot sea water and rose water and a 20 min face massage. Slippers, robe, relaxation area with lots of tisana (herb tea), bottles of water. A large warm indoor seawater pool with hydrojets. I was there for 4 hours. The staff were all so lovely and friendly and good at their job even though it is Ramadan. I saw a poster at Reception for another excellent package  - 275 TND for breakfast, lunch, use of pool, 40 min massage, 30 min facial, and use of a suite room all day. There was a 50 TND single supplement but still a wonderful experience for the price. There was a lovely helpful lady on reception called Ghada who got staff to take me to meals (2 different restaurants - the hotel is like a huge palace - art work and marble everywhere). She also took me to my room. Again, Mohamed had everything perfectly organised in the Spa and was kind enough to change the facial until after lunch. Restaurant staff was excellent too, as was the food. One young waiter (with a long Turkish name) went out of his way to make me a \"caffe latte\" (I found the cappuccino from the machine a bit too sweet). The rooms are luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. Everywhere was quiet because it is low season which was perfect for me.  This is a uniquely exquisite hotel with a fabulous Spa and wonderful staff who provide outstanding service. I am very grateful to have experienced being here."

The thalasso center is well organized, its staff is competent and attentive, as well as reception, cleaning, beach and restaurants. The breakfast buffet is impeccable, good coffee machine and real orange juice, etc. The à la carte restaurant, for us included in the half board offers a Tunisian menu and a European menu, starters, meat, fish and desserts of very good quality. Little downside, prefer the à la carte restaurant to the very hearty buffet and with choice, but a tone below culinary level. In total very little extra expenses, water and wine at table at very reasonable rates. We will definitely come back with friends next time.."

The courtesy tray is shameful, cheap kettle that leaks responsible for short circuit, instant coffee when all over the world you find espresso makers. Decent breakfast for a 5 star, already seen better with a neighbor. Not enough material, we wait 45 minutes for a pancake!  No children's club so punished with thalassotherapy if you come with family! The 120 dinars dinner is also not exceptional and children pay as much as adults for 2 slices of pizza and ice cream. No drinks included despite the Award.  In short this is not the luxury 5 star I expected given the fame and especially the Award paid."

The staff, whatever their profession, are smiling, polite, professional.

        "review_text": "Royal Garden Palace has its charm, but it's clear that its best days are behind it. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant team – especially the evening shift – was professional and welcoming.  Desserts were top-notch, but beef dishes were a letdown: steaks were overcooked and rubbery, and stews needed much more time to become tender. On the bright side, fish and shrimp were delicious. The Tunisian night and local cuisine were real highlights!  Entertainment options were quite limited, which is a downside considering there isn’t much to do outside the hotel. The crocodile farm is about 3 km away – worth the walk on your own.  The hotel surroundings feel neglected, and while camels and horses on the beach might sound exotic, the mess they leave behind is less appealing.  Overall: a decent one-time experience, but not a place we’d return to."

Rust on the ceiling of the hall at night, animals in the drawers, refrigerator cooling very little, and so on. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our knowledge."

The only downside is the restoration, we find its happiness because it is varied but very repetitive. Large selection of vegetables, fruits and desserts Grilled meats are not tender and fish are full of bones. The cooks and the quality of the ingredients are not worthy of a 5 star...But that doesn't stop us from having very good times."

        "review_text": "As with many hôtels in Djerba the star rating reflects a distant past and there are a few glaring standards that differentiate this hotel from a truly luxury one. Firstly the dreadful all inclusive package  , limiting the guest to really substandard quality ingredients. All cocktails are bulk premixed stock and when served look nothing like their exotic namesakes. My husband and I don't drink alcohol but enjoy a 0.0 beer. Not available at this 5 star luxury establishment and the management refused to get some in for our stay. Even a shack on the beach had it for sale. And finally the indignity of trying to get a sunlounger around the pool. Forget it after 07.15. Despite the hotel clearly scorning the practice of towel dropping they do nothing to discourage it. In my opinion this alone puts it in a 3 star bracket. We are still at the hotel for another week, so will update as and when."

Carpeting more than aging in the hallways. Paints to refresh.  In May no air conditioning... surely to save money... the restaurant decent food I'm difficult but I ate to my hunger. the organization of catering services should be reviewed. Not all the tables are available because they're already ready for the following services. At the pool if you want a deckchair either early... napkins put on and people spend 10 minutes there during the day.  At 5:00 p.m. the staff is already packing the deckchair rugs. The staff is friendly. The flies are annoying! The spa is not bad and cheap. Good massages and friendly masseuses. Cleanliness of the toilets more cleaning in the day would not be a luxury.  The room is aging but suitable. No air conditioning in low season (May!) Here's a good stay but don't trust the nice photos and video with nice filters."

Cons: Old hotel, far from the 5 islands. Old and poorly cleaned rooms. After 3 days we changed the room following the nuisance of a nightclub next to the hotel (room 3356). Then we were quiet but we had to insist on making this change. The meals are correct but not very diversified. We eat the same thing every day. Sometimes lacks a little freshness especially at the pool restaurant.  Despite these many negative points we had a great family stay but we will not go back."

Carpets are worn out, showers black  The bedding, on the other hand, is good   Moreover, it is sad to note that in 2025 tourists continue to book their deckchair for fear of running out. They drop off a towel in the morning early, go for a walk and come back in the afternoon by the pool quietly. Honest people find themselves struggling to find a place.  See the photo.... It is representative of the whole pool. Dozens and dozens of reserved deckchairs and nobody in the water   This is abnormal and the hotel does nothing which is even more serious. Many hotels have started to hunt for the debiles.   In short, the hotel will leave us no memorable memories."

Quick cleaning. Separate toilets are fine provided that the flushing system works despite various maintenance interventions.  Carpeting in the floors marks signs of wear, deserves a new hit.   - The indoor restaurant lunch and evening at will: clean, white tablecloth, fabric towel, the buffet very varied but tasteless, except the excellent Tunisian buffet on Saturday evening,  ( 1 correct meal over a week!) If, in the evening, you dine at the first service you will have to forget your aperitif at the piano bar, there is the bar but no musician, (musician will be there when you are at the restaurant)  I hold breakfast with fresh juice minute, boiled egg, various appetizing preparations. Thank you, Murad. - The outdoor restaurant swimming pool open at lunch: impossible to lunch because there are flies. The different pool and indoor bars are very good: the staff recognize the guests and always have a friendly word.  - A special mention and a big THANK YOU in general to all the staff who are extremely kind, friendly, from the reception, to the waiters, pool, maid, passing by the animators:   The welcome with a smile, the nice little word, is what makes this hotel strong but unfortunately it does not replace the shortcomings. I don't forget the massages we probably wouldn't come back to this hotel without"

Reception hall and interior quite classy despite the age of the hotel.  Three small shops present and Moorish coffee with free mint tea. Sellers of outside activities not insistent. Welcoming and very pleasant staff. WIFI throughout the hotel even at the beach.  Large unheated outdoor pool. Wooden deckchair with insufficient mattress.  Heated indoor pool with jacuzzi that triggers with motion detector. Very little sunbed in it.  Very spacious room with good bedding but soundproofing is non-existent.      Separate toilet.  Bathroom with a bathtub which is very high making it difficult to access. Quid for the elderly who are in majority.  Television with French channels via satellite but which picks up regularly. Bathrobe available in the room. Safe and refrigerator stocked daily. Necessary to make coffee or tea. Cleaning done every day.  Main restaurant room on a human scale. 2 services scheduled for the evening at 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Table numbered and allocated for the entire stay for evening meals only. Rigorous pants. Lunch from noon to 1 p.m. Nice waiters. Very good food but not much variety. Fresh juice at breakfast which is increasingly rare. Fresh bread every day. Outside restaurant next to the pool opens at 12:30.   At that time not open at night and beach bar always closed. Pancakes in the afternoon. Beautiful beach cleaned every day. Sufficient number of sunbeds.  Presence of dogs that are not aggressive but bark regularly. Basic day and evening entertainment without atmosphere. Virtually non-existent animators.   SPA and TUNISIAN restaurant not tested but very frequented.  In summary, this hotel is very quiet but with some charm. Suitable for older people who want to rest. Not suitable for families with teens as this is not a club hotel."

Special thanks must go to the animators, who made our vacation even more enjoyable and were able to entertain people despite the not always favorable weather. Apart from the hotel, the beach was perfect, that one was one of the main reasons why we chose this hotel. However, this hotel is definitely not suitable for people who prefer a more \"luxurious\" vacation. But we were extremely satisfied and we will certainly be happy to come back when there is an opportunity. However, we consider it a disadvantage that time passes much faster here, and out of a 7-day stay, we felt that we were only here for 3 days. haha :)"

However our time we had there, the hotel lacks its basics, we had to keep going up and down to reception for either towels or toilet rolls, and we had to tell reception multiple times about our sink in our and none of them really seem bothered. It’s more of a 1 star than a 3 star. When we arrived our room wasnt ready yet however this was ok considering check in isn’t until 3pm, but the most annoying thing was the 2 sales men trying to sell excursions and also massages, these were both very over priced and they really hassle you coming up to you everyday, at one point before we got our room we had them both sat with us, luckily the customer relation lady who was thankfully English saved us, her name i think is sophia, very lovely! The hotel is about a 2 and half hour transfer, so dont book if you want something closer to the airport. There fore there is some good things about this hotels which was the food which we enjoyed everyday, we just didnt enjoy breakfast as its like a cattle market in there. The animation team are great, always getting you involved! Unfortunately though we wont back."

We felt confident and especially not harassed as we could have been from other hotels. Very good massages practiced by two very professional masseuses. To do! Little point to improve: wifi accessible in the rooms as on the beach 🙏🏻 is essential to be able to return and reconcile: work and relaxation in your beautiful environment. I highly recommend this beautiful place if you want to recharge with family or friends in peace. Value for money top 👍  See you soon 👋"

We feasted on grilled fish and delicious pastries. All the staff is adorable at the reception, animation, beach, maintenance, restaurant everywhere very pleasant discreet and considerate. The rooms are simple and very clean with air conditioning. The only improvement would be to have wifi everywhere and not only in the lobby but otherwise do not change anything we will come back for sure!!!"

The selection of food was really large but also tasty, sweet cakes, fresh fruits and cold juices contributed to my meal. The hotel staff, from the reception to the waiters, are very kind and nice. Special praise for the not good but the best waiter who was always available is Chiheb Eddin, smiling, cheerful and always at the service of the guest. Also, in addition to clean rooms, wonderful staff and workers in the hotel, there are also stars of the hotel, the animation group Schibo, Kiki, Ayman, Chef, Hossem, Mimi, Soula and Khoulound. They made my vacation better, taught me a lot of dances and kept my attention the whole time and no they are not good they are the best team. I will return to Tunisia again for them.See you son 🫶."

Without forgetting of course the invasion of tiger mosquitoes whether in rooms, swimming pools, gardens and even restaurants, so bring a powerful repellent. only positive point is the beach."

Lots of pigeons around the rooms. Safe paying 1€/day. Tourist tax very expensive 28€ / person for a week. All the staff at the hotel are very helpful and kind. Beach at the foot of the hotel, not very large. Lots of seaweed. Hotel located about 50 minutes from the airport. Zarzis small town where there is not much and where we are docked all the time to buy. Food at the hotel of medium quality and not very diversified, my friend caught the tourista after 2 days. Nice but medium animations. Change of euro in dinars possible at the hotel reception. Beach/swimming pool towels available for 10€ deposit per towel.  We won’t come back to that."

In short I would not come back to this hotel, I often go to Djerba, many hotels are much better than this one. The beach is small with seaweed!!."

The aquatic area is vast and perfectly maintained, offering relaxation and entertainment. We also participated in very well organized excursions, supervised by Mourad, whom we thank warmly. Many thanks also to Kali, the manager of Coralia, for his availability and constant attention.  The entertainment team also deserves special mention: dynamic, professional and always smiling, they contributed greatly to the success of our stay.  The diet is good and varied, we do not eat the same thing twice.  The servers are at your disposal to offer you the best possible service.  And it is without counting on the team of the spa area that has been great too.  Everything was perfect. If you are planning a trip to Tunisia, we highly recommend this property.   Value for money , difficult to do better."

Their ingenuity in organizing games for children and adults is acceptable. They can create an unforgettable atmosphere, and their participation makes the vacation even more successful. Thanks to them, we say a firm \"no\" to boredom! Animators are not only people who organize games and fun, but also friends who make sure that everyone feels good and has something to do. Their creativity and are contagious, and a vacation with them is a guarantee of great fun and lots of memories. With joy They always involve everyone in their activities, from morning gymnastics to evening performances. They are the ones who make the vacation an unforgettable adventure, full of energy. The hotel is fine, the rooms are fairly clean, which is a big plus. The staff tries to keep things tidy, and cleaning is done regularly. The food at the hotel is good. Breakfasts are tasty and varied, lunches and dinners are also at a good level, with a varied menu. Overall, the stay is pleasant, and the value for money is appropriate."

We now only want to return to Djerba with Alain, meet real people and wonderful places with him. We recommend its services without any hesitation"

        "review_text": "I spent a week in this Pension; Plus: spacious room with living room and kitchen care. Nice little pool.  The least: poor wifi quality. No wifi in the room.  I had half board: breakfast and dinner. The first day, the waiter asks you: do you want a fresh lemon juice or strawberry (without telling you that it’s for a fee) and he does it with all foreign tourists but not the locals. So you find yourself paying for a drink full of sugar at 10 dinars (a fortune there). So beware, if you are offered this in the morning you will know that it is 10 dinars. I have seen scenes where foreign parents take juice for the whole family while it is included in breakfast, they then find themselves paying 40 or 50 dinars.   Unpleasant reception (a man in his fifties with glasses) he takes people from above and shouts at customers. Just surreal scenes.  Private beach away from the Inn. We have to walk and especially find her...   I'm not coming back to this Pension."

        "review_text": "Djerbian Masfouf in the dry! I had the chance and privilege to test it in preview and what a great culinary adventure! Particularly delicious to find the words that would describe the flavor of this dish ...  the masfouf is far from being provocative, he challenges you with finesse especially the pepper that overloads the masfouf with a lot of confidence and grants him an authentic visual. The heart of the matter is a journey into a universe of flavors from which one cannot detach: delicacy, an amazing dosage of spices so well balanced: a feat! As for the dry ones, they are in total fusion with the masfouf ... you close your eyes and it is the sea that immediately settles in your imagination ....presumably the Masfouf aux secs is evocative and crystallizes everything that Djerba can offer to its visitors: a unique alloy and without equal of authenticity and openness. Congratulations Chief, Congratulations to the entire Toumana Gardens team!"

The good: a beautiful pool yard   The bad: my room was derelict, renovated well over a decade ago. The AC did not work, dampened the floor, everything. The “welcome” desk was the coldest in my 50 years travelling, no courtesy.   The ugly: in Tunez there are no private beaches, but the government rents them all the way up to 3 meters from the water. We seated in the beach with the same name as the hotel, we were expelled by 5 guards. The hotel reception never gave us direction on which was their beach, when I told them what happened, no apologies, they did not care.   Summary, one of my worst experiences as a tourist in over 148 countries."

        "review_text": "Maybe I live on another planet, but I really didn't like this hotel. The rudest staff ever especially Jamal at the front desk who charged me the local tax for an extra night when I wasn't staying there and kept the money for himself. I have been travelling in Tunisia a while and this was the worst hotel so far. Yes, my previous two hotels were luxury 5-star but I had stayed in other 3-star hotels during my trip. The positives. Nice grounds and setting. Clean. Huge room like an apartment with a kitchen area if you want to cook anything. WIFI worked well. Now, why I didn't like it. The room was like an oven. There is air conditioning but this didn't work well and mainly flowed in the lounge area rather than the bedroom. I struggled to sleep. It was cooler outside! The bathroom was very basic. No complimentary water provided. There is a small supermarket opposite the hotel and what appeared to be a coffee shop but other than that, the area is pretty dead with nothing around. You need a car or a taxi to move around. My room rate did not include any meals but suggest adding them. As I said, there is not much around. I included breakfast and had the buffet dinner twice during my stay. Breakfast was a basic buffet, but adequate with breads, pastries, an egg station and more. Not huge at all but enough. Coffee was awful. The dinner buffet was fine. Again not a huge selection but enough. The food was nice but skip the desserts, too sickly sweet. Drinks are not included. Cheap. They have an à la carte menu too for dinner which mainly includes Western dishes. I got a little bit annoyed with the waiters as they kept hovering over you when eating, watching and all I wanted was to be left in peace. On my first night, I was encouraged to have something from the à la carte menu but why do I want to have pizza and pasta when I can have that at home? Go for the buffet. Reception staff were unfriendly and never greeted you. My stay was meant to be for 4 nights but I checked out after 2 and went to another nicer hotel. There is a small swimming pool as well. Not for me."

The meals are simple but very good and the catering staff are adorable (special mention to Aziz and the evening service manager whose name I forgot at the restaurant and to Ahmed at reception). Very spacious accommodation and cleaning is done every day. However, the paints in the bathrooms should be refreshed. We were full board and that doesn't include any drinks (not even water). I just find it a shame that a bottle of water was not offered when we arrived with the heat. We had to go to the bar to buy some. You can easily get around by taxi for very little money and go to the Géant to do your shopping. I also recommend the Tataouine excursion with Omar (who you will find every day at the swimming pool) much cheaper than that offered by the Tour operator (FTI concerning us) and exactly the same thing (we found the Tour Operator bus at each stop...). However, we heard people complaining about the other excursions offered by Omar, to see... We booked a tour of the island by taxi with FTI: very friendly driver but who stopped us in shops where he received commissions in Houmet Souk... In short, if you want to relax, you've come to the right place, even if personally, I would have appreciated a little atmosphere in the evening from time to time without it being a big fiesta."

The beach where there were chairs and umbrellas is a short walk.  Daily maid service.  This is a resort to which customers, mostly French and German return to year after year. While it may be a little warm around the edges, for the price and spaciousness of the accommodation it earns our 5."

The rooms were spacious, clean. The buffet food quality varied from ok-to-great. The front desk service from Ahmed was exceptional - he helped us out with any questions, swiftly. Ahmed connected us to a local tours guide who got us great deals on a dromedary tour and a dune buggy drive. The spa had fantastic deals on massages as well, which was great for spoiling the whole family. Lovely pool. The only real frustration was that the Wifi was unreliable in our room.

        "review_text": "It’s a nice place if you want to relax by the pool. That area is clean and the food from the restaurant is mostly good (skip the pizza). It would be nice if there were more local dishes on the snack menu.   I was told they have a private beach, yet when I followed the signs to Toumana Beach it’s just a dirty beach at the end of a road. There’s quite a bit of garbage and animal poo. The resorts on either side do a better job at keeping their beach clean. This area also has A LOT of seaweed in the water and on the beach. It’s definitely not the beautiful turquoise water I saw in pictures. I found the beach by La Marsa (near Tunis) to be much nicer.   As for the hotel, on first presentation, everything looks nice - reception area, pool, room. ...but upon closer inspection is when you find flaws. The walls in the room had yellow and brown stains. The towel and bed sheets had stains. Room WiFi had no internet access because the network jack wasn’t active. Lights outside room didn’t work. There’s a kitchen in room but few utensils and no dish soap. The reception staff didn’t seem to care and often seemed slightly annoyed at having to help you. The guy who worked the evening shift was particularly bad. I asked about getting a bowl to use in the kitchen and he said probably not but he’d check. I knew he wasn’t going to bother checking. I also asked about getting the lights outside my room fixed. Similar response - he’d check, but I knew he couldn’t be bothered. No one working there knew the password for the outdoor WiFi (it had a different password than reception WiFi).   If I were to go back, I think I’d try to find somewhere by a nicer stretch of beach."

We stayed for three nights, initially thought about making trips around the island and out for dinner but the pool, beach and food couldn't be beaten. The kitchens are well equipped if you want to make your own food, but we didn't because the restaurant food is so good and such great value."

The reception staff was rude and childish. The parking was horrendous (only a small stretch in front of the door that could fit two cars maximum). The massages sent me to my chiropractor. The food made street food look like five star cuisine. The cleaning crew used so much bleach it would give a passerby a migraine.  I would have rather slept on the street.

This kind of remark is inappropriate, especially since we have always been courteous.  This is a sign of a real lack of professionalism, and whatever you think of the French, it reveals your personal opinion.  But that's not the main topic.  We believe that you were not completely honest, as we had paid a deposit before being forced to pay the entire stay. What is even more disturbing is that we have all the evidence to support this payment. It seems that at Hotel Nour, the money goes in easily....but never comes out.  We are still waiting for the refund of the deposit paid........"

A table decorated for a birthday, and a wedding anniversary. However, the evening entertainment is rubbish and boring. Apart from making hellish noise until 11:00 p.m. and disturbing people who come to rest, no point. Go to a nightclub. Visit the Mahdia market on Friday morning and take the train in front of the hotel. Go see El Jem, Sousse and M Sakem, 50km around. We rented a car, be careful, people over 75 are not allowed to drive."

        "review_text": "Firstly, the hotel is clean, spotless. However we had issues during our three night stay: the first night we went for dinner and the couscous, the potatoes and the pizza were all cold. The next morning we went for breakfast 30 minutes before it stopped being available, 9.30, and there was an empty container which had once offered scrambled egg and just one croissant. Food was generally very average. Our room was lovely, a suite overlooking the pool, but we had issues with towels: they took them away when they cleaned the room but didn’t replace them with clean ones unless I went to reception to ask; on the penultimate day they also removed the dressing gowns and I had to ask for these to be replaced. The pool was often crowded in an after as it seems they sell daily access for 60TND which many locals take advantage of. The room was listed as all inclusive on booking.com but only soft drinks are included so it clearly is not all inclusive. All in all, we didn’t think we got value for money at €300 per night. If you have a sweet tooth there is an abundance of choice every meal"

The hotel features a pool with a lounge and all day dining. I visited in Feb so couldn’t benefit from the pool or the beach.  Staff is helpful in general, some need bit of reiteration but good all in all. Rooms are clean with basic amenities.  Minibar is empty which is not helpful for someone coming on a long journey especially if the hotel has no sundries or vending machines to buy few stuff.  Housekeeping service is on though they cleaned up my room despite putting a don’t disturb sign on my door.  Food is ok, not the greatest."

The room was very plain and the decor very tired. Since the revolution, times have been hard in Tunisia and are only just recovering, unfortunately the Nour was suffering as the resort was very quiet. There was no AC on in the reception, bar or dining room, which made it very uncomfortable. A request for a beer was declined at the outside bar in the afternoon but I am unsure why. It may have been Ramadan or just closed but food was available. As we finished our meal, the table next to us received beer and wine! This review is based on the situation in August 2012 and things may well improve as the country gets back on its feet and the tourist return. The other aspect is that this resort is predominately French, so take that as you find it."

        "review_text": "We arrived at the hotel and the staff were waiting to take suitcases. We went for lunch first and then back to reception to be taken to our room.(we requested the ground floor in an email) The room was ground floor and in the main building. The room was great, with a large bed and a huge shower. It had a fridge and loads of cupboard space. The staff in the restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were great and very attentive to our needs. Always there with drinks with a smile. The food was very good, and even someone who's fussy could eat here. The gala night was amazing. The food was so special. Roast beef , potatoes, and prawn cocktails.  The bars were great as well. A different specialised cocktail every day. There are 3 bars. The beach, pool, and lobby. All the staff are amazing in these. The pools are great as well. The quiet pool was great for me. No kids, no music and no mobiles. The pool is cold and very clean. The main pool at the pool bar is good. The top half is warm and the bottom cold. This was the main area for most of the activities. Water polo and aqua aerobics. There had darts and other games. The animation team is fabulous. They always said hi and would always have a kind words to say to you. I have to give a shout out to MoMo he is brilliant and so funny. That man has more energy than anyone i know. I had my birthday here and the restaurant manager did everything to make it so special. I had a beautiful chocolate cake with candles and the staff sang to me. I had lovely sparkling wine(that was pretty ordered by my fiance) chilled waiting for me. This hotel is a fabulous place to go in tunisia. Now for the bad stuff. Some of the equipment could be done with an upgrade. The darts and board. The flights on the archery arrows.  Now for the unsung hero's.  The cleaners this place is spotless, and the cleaners are always about cleaning the restaurant toilets and everything. The gardeners this place has some beautiful scenery."

The food was one of the best we have had at an all inclusive hotel. The drinks were good (although we could not get drunk for love nor money) the bar staff in all three bars were really good. We like to have a drink and relax on the balcony in the evenings and they would even provide us with a tray for us to take our drinks back! The animation team were brilliant and really engaging with everyone! Big shout out to Steve, Azza and kris, i dont know where they get their energy from!!! The waiters in the restaurant were very nice, even by the end of our two week stay getting our drinks on the table ready for us to eat!!  Only side really was no air-con as its seasonal and the same for the bbq restaurant. It would have been nice to experience that. All in all a fantastic 2 weeks."

We had not been to Tunisia for many years and this time we were just blown away by what we experienced! An immaculate hotel kept clean by a fantastic housekeeping team. The beach is just like a Caribbean experience,  a big thank you to Mansour Mohammed the life guard and the Security guys on the beach for looking after us, they are really special guys.  The food was some of the best we have experienced on any holiday and we travel on average 3 times a year.  Plenty of choice every single day and a Salad bar which was amazing! The Restaurant team are a fantastic, Mohammed MTIR a waiter on the outside terrace looked after us, this man is credit to the hotel. The Beer, Wine & Cocktails were really good and our men are really fussy with their beer but they said it is the best they have ever had whilst o  holiday.  We only saw 2 shows and found they were not for us and we did not partake in any daytime activities but the show & activities teams were very pleasant. When we arrived we were the last coach transfer to be dropped off so guessed that we would be 1st pick for our return journey which turned out to be correct as they were going to pick us up at 5.20am for a 10.20 flight !, we sourced a private taxi for 100 dinar (£25 approx) which was worth it and we were still the 1st in the airport check in queue! Would we return to the Delfino beach hotel? Absolutely YES!  We love it and are already looking to return later in the year. Just a couple of little negatives: The air conditioning was not on at the hotel as its seasonal,  the A La Carte & bbq restaurants were also not yet open,  I understand that there has to be a cut off date but the option would have been an added bonus but these little niggles do not spoil our experience in any way, a massive thanks to management & staff for a brilliant holiday!"

We choose not to participate in activities or entertainment but find that Willie goes out of his way to give us a little of his time every single day. He is a true professional and very loyal in his work. The food is always beautiful. We will recommend this hotel as we have found it faultless.

        "review_text": "We’ve just spent a week here and honestly had the best time !  The staff were all so lovely and helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The grounds of the resort were beautiful and really well maintained. One morning I was sitting in our room’s garden and one of the gardeners picked some flowers and gave them to me. There were also a few cats and kittens on the grounds which we loved ! My husband had a great time at the buffet at breakfast, lunch and dinner and had 4 plates each time. The private beach was nice, and our room also had a sea view which was great. I spent most of my week by the quiet pool, and really appreciated the peacefulness of it. Our room was very clean and spacious.  I always try to write a balanced review, and with that in mind there are a few points I’d like to mention, however these are in no way negatives and wouldn’t stop us from staying here again. I am unfortunately a picky eater, and while there was plenty of food, it was a little limited for me, however I am aware that being a picky eater is my problem, not the resorts ! Our bathroom did at times have a bit of a drain smell, but nothing that opening our door and getting some fresh air into the room didn’t fix. The room was quite western, and I had been hoping for more of a Tunisian theme. One of the spotlights by our bed didn’t work, and the other had fallen out of the socket. Part of the fixture on the bathroom door was loose. The water is obviously treated so has a chlorine taste/smell so some more bottle refill stations around the place wouldn’t go amiss, using so many plastic bottles felt quite wasteful. The resort is quite isolated as my husband found during his walks, there wasn’t much around and the area was quite dirty and smelly - obviously does not affect our opinion of the resort. There is a supermarket and pharmacy about 15 mins away.   All in all, we had an amazing week here, and would definitely recommend staying here !"

The black and white dinner was brilliant. Food was as very good. Especially for our very fussy 17 year old who lives off chicken nuggets and chips.

We had an fantastic spa experience would definitely recommend, the girls at the spa are brilliant and really made us feel special & very spoilt a good price too. The only advice I would give is bring pounds/Euros to change at reception as the card machines are rubbish. 10 dinars work out about £2.50 5 dinars about £1.25 We used to tip waiters/bar staff a couple of times throughout the day.  We had such a relaxing chilled week we are booking again for next year."

The baby cot proposed for our 4-month-old daughter had a broken bar, dirty because of the hair present. The rooms have not cleaned properly: there are always traces left on the sink EVERY time, the sheets are not changed but reused, the bed is not always well made. We ordered breakfast in bed the first morning .. catastrophic: we had a complete assortment of buffet offered downstairs certainly, but everything was mixed (butter, strawberry jam, honey apricot jam on a small plate...), the pastries are poor qualities, the bread is hard. The air conditioning does not work at all: the nights were excessively hot and therefore unpleasant, the only window present barely opens so it was impossible to cool the room. I put a star because it is not possible to put any stars: I do NOT recommend at ALL, the price charged by the hotel for the stay is too high compared to the quality proposed, I strongly advise against: if you want a good stay in Tunis, avoid this hotel and everything will be fine!"

The bathroom is big as well. It had a mini bar, a kettle, and a TV. In the morning, I had breakfast there. It was varied and tasty. The staff is also friendly and helpful, especially the lady in the restaurant. The location is good and very central. There are plenty of shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants around.  The only bad thing was that there was a horrible smell around 6 am. coming from the air-conditioning. It was so strong that it woke me up.  All in all, the stay for one night was OK, and you get what you pay for, and for that budget, what they are offering is excellent."

The room was a nice size. It wasn't 100% clean if you properly check the floor. Even though you get a cleaner daily. It seemed, it was not even hovered. The bedsheets and pillow cases smelled like domestos everyday, which bothered us to sleep. I think they use lots of bleach but not fabric conditioner. People were probably smoking in the rooms and smoking was also allowed in the bar so we were smelling it from the 5th floor. Breakfast was good enough. There were same things every day but it was enough for us so I can't complain. The location was perfect, close to the restaurants and old town(medina). It was also very safe as there were so many police officers around 24hrs. Reception contacted me when they couldn't see us until 8pm. It was very nice of them that they cared about us as we were two ladies. Overall we were satisfied with our stay. I can definitely recommend this hotel and if I plan to go to Tunis again, it definitely will be the same hotel in terms of staff and location. Thank you for everything 🙏🏻"

He literally threw my ticket in my face telling me that it is not a currency exchange office. Let me come back and pay in Dinard.

The rooms - we had a triple - are large and functional. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom is large and well organised. The level of hygiene is also good and the breakfast included in the price is varied. The only thing that could perhaps be improved was the Wi-Fi signal in the rooms. The reception is open 24 hours a day and for those traveling by car there is a secure paid car park not far away. Advised."

The restaurant is tucked away at the rear of the hotel, a badly lit room with no windows and nothing hot to eat except toast. Very disappointing.  Something to be aware of  at the moment is that the hotel is situated next to a government building of some kind, and taxi's cannot park outside he hotel, and have to take pot luck, which means a considerable struggle if you have heavy luggage. Although not the hotel's fault, they are certainly very quiet about this on the website.   They are also very very reluctant to accept credit cards, and are more than happy to pretend to take payment and 'decline' you card, to force you to produce the cash."

        "review_text": "Rooms are very small and very basic, like a jail cell with one very tiny window. Rooms temperature is controlled by the management so they choose if you get air conditioning or not. So when it’s hot outside, your room is very very hot too but when you tell them, they act like it is the first time they are hearing it; don’t be fooled, they know exactly what’s going on.   Service in the front desk with the exception of two people is completely non-existent and you have to try very hard to get service and responses. The girl in the front desk with the black hair is usually smoking in the back office and playing on her phone and the restaurant staff have to tell her to come out to serve at the front desk. The other blonde haired girl, her name starts with A, is very mean and rude to most guests Omar and Asma are very nice. Housekeeping is super slow and not organized.   Restaurant staff provide no service at all, not even a greeting. If you ask a question, they clearly are not happy to be disturbed from playing on their cellphones. They hide in the corner and gossip all throughout the meal service and play on their phone.   It is not walking distance to the Old Town, it’s quite a walk so be very prepared to walk or take a taxi. Use Bolt Taxi and drop the price 3 dinars if you want to negotiate a rate.   Airport to hotel from departure area was about 7 dinars but you can get it at about five dinars.   Food is horrible at the hotel but they do serve an overpriced breakfast buffet.   Outside it is very Sandy and dusty."

We were placed in a family room communicating with our friends and asked from the day after our arrival to change rooms.We were promised the change of room within 24 hours and we still wait.We did not force our request too bad for us.  Same for airport transfers to the club you will make many stops to pick up other tourists at various hotels  You can easily check in and take a solo taxi it is easier.  Also no pick up at the airport for our return  We had to be met at the airport for our check-in and again nobody  As for the hotel, air conditioning is in operation mid June, gym closed swimming pool not heated.  You can't change before 10:00 in the morning, not very practical when you go on an excursion at 8:00.  For the positive the catering is good , room staff , housekeeping , our friend Tyson as well as the photographer are on top.  So a big disappointment for FRAM We are still waiting for a call following the changes in flight hours that we will be told we can not help and the same for the room.  Where's our FRAMISSIMA?"

All inclusive really complete. Watch out for world trips where The goal is to sell Ahmed to you Services 4x4 with supposedly dunes which are actually only two small sandy hills along the road to go to Tataouine and all this with a guide who speeds you and tells you every two minutes groupir.conclusion take the bus for 25 euros less it is the same\"nomadic / beer\" you have absolutely no more time in 4x4 than in bus thank you Ahmed for his good advice.(Irony of course) Thank you to the people at the restaurant and cleaning who are themselves very nice and of remarkable kindness.

The terrace is the most beautiful part of this hotel. Although the service here is ok, the beach bar is ripe for the wrecking hammer. The outdoor pool and indoor pool are also ok. The rest of the building is in need of a total renovation. The rooms are old, everything is worn out, bathroom (shower in bath without handles) is a danger to the many elderly persons staying there. No heating in the rooms in winter. Smoking is allowed inside around reception / bar and in the morning before cleaning it smells like an old cafe. When the weather is, exceptionally, bad, it rains in many places inside, including in the restaurant. The food is decent. There are some hard-working friendly people working here but both in the reception and in the restaurant and just about everywhere there are a lot of misogynistic handsy machos, there is no professionalism here and in some places, such as the animation team where there are a lot of friendly, professional young people working, there are also aggressive people who really should not be in contact with the public! In my case, I was harassed by Ricky, who seemed to get away with everything because you can't count on any help here as a female customer. Nevertheless, mainly due to the sunny weather I had a wonderful time  Although Djerba is a lovely island to spend the winter I can't recommend this hotel for female singles looking for a quiet stay..."

        "review_text": "I had a great holiday, everything was perfect and the food excellent. Mimo, Louis, Nina and Salma have been exceptional facilitators, always dynamic and involved. However, Riki and Mike, who claim to be animators, are a real disappointment. Their only concern is not to animate but to sell , and harass customers by wanting to sell bingo at 120 dinars (see + at the head of the customer) and personalized items at +80 dinars, especially Mike. Their behavior is shameful and petty. Reki spends her time watching the animators, analyzing and staring at women including my fiancée, which is totally unacceptable. Moreover, he only dances with young people and lets the “interns” take care of the elderly, which is deeply disrespectful. Mike, on the other hand, does nothing constructive except force sales, and openly insult “fat” customers “who will explode” during cooking classes. We were outraged to hear that he was trying to sell his fox scarf (with dangling legs 400€ to a hotel guest).  These two “chefs” are incompetent and behave like opportunistic salespeople, totally disconnected from the role of animator. That doesn't respect customers. Fortunately Mimo, Nina, Louis and Salma are professional, caring and really involved in the well-being of holidaymakers."

Entertainment in the evenings was good apart from the Karaoke which was painful at times when unknown songs are sang but the team always try and get everyone involved, but we enjoyed all the shows. The reception staff work very hard . The beach is lovely for a walk.we stay when it sunshine by the bigest garden really it's so famous. Finally we recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "After a long trip, we were shocked upon entering our room on the third floor. It was dirty, the carpet was torn, there was no light in the bathroom, and although we were two friends, we were given a room with only one double bed. When we showed the video evidence to the reception staff, they offered us a quadruple room on the first floor, explaining that all rooms on the third floor needed renovation (so be cautious when booking). The new room was clean and acceptable for a 4-star hotel. We didn't have a minibar, and despite daily complaints, it wasn’t resolved. Eventually, the staff admitted that many guests had the same issue and there was nothing they could do. The food was varied and hygienic but lacked taste. There were long lines of people waiting to be served as the hotel was overcrowded. The pool was unclean until our last day; it appears they only clean it on Thursdays. The big waterslide was also out of service for our entire stay. The after-dinner entertainment was just music playing, with no dedicated staff or activities like in other hotels. The staff generally lacked hospitality, with the exception of one woman at the reception who was very kind. When we chose this hotel, we expected a better experience. Overall, Tunisia is a beautiful country, and that’s what we really came for."

        "review_text": "After my 5th stay at this hotel I only think about booking my 6th stay. The hotel is still beautiful on the outside, the gardeners do a great job...the environment is very soothing. Here everything is huge, so you never feel on top of each other. The restaurant offers a wide choice of dishes, grills, salads, desserts... just a few yogurts are missing at lunch and in the evening. The rooms are very spacious and very well equipped even if the weather starts to do its work, some elements would perhaps need to be renewed and some local decorative objects would be beautiful to immerse us totally in this country. For a 5* it really lacks a wellness area offering various massages or even a hairdressing corner. The immense plus, and most important for me, of this hotel is the staff, that I love them these people! they always take care of me, they pamper me from the first to the last day. This is my second home and my second family. Many thanks to the whole team and especially to Cherif, Nizar, Marwen and Faiten at the reception, Amel, Abnour and Osama at the restaurant, Leilà for the room, Djamel, Sem and Sabre at the pool and the beach....they do a great job very professional, they always have a smile, they are of an extreme kindness, they anticipate the needs of customers and they have their hearts on hand. Here is my oxygen bubble, I feel wonderfully good. I can't wait to see you again and get my gold bracelet with my loyalty card:-)"

In that review I criticised senior management and the food served within the restaurant, also criticised other areas. Early evening on day I reviewed hotel, we were in our room when we got a phone call inviting us to a meeting with the Manager/ Director of hotel. We sat in his office for 30 minutes where he took notes of all our grievances and promised things would change. To be fair to the Manager he only took up his position 6 days ago.  In the 3 days since original review, we have seen a huge difference in lots of areas, there are more waiters round pool area and service is now excellent, no waiting for over an hour to get a drink.  The food has improved with more variety, it is not perfect but it is definitely a lot better and continues to improve, keep up the good work and improving.  This hotel has some amazing hard working staff, who are very friendly and always welcome you with a warm smile. Hopefully the new management will continue to support the staff and keep improving things.  Finally, I just want to say, that my review was genuinely how I felt at the time, the hotel picked up on it and reacted positively by reaching out and listening to our concerns then decided to do something about it. They have turned a negative into a positive within 3 days."

Rooms are huge and lovely with comfortable bed and pillows which were cleaned daily. There is a lovely sandy beach on the doorstep with camels and horses walking along for rides if wanted, along with jetskis. The 24 hour bar was lovely and relaxing but for more family entertainment then to go to the sister hotel next door where a full animation team worked hard to amuse everyone day and night. The pool was lovely but unfortunately too cold to use as the weather was unusually mixed, but the heated indoor pool was a godsend. Thank you for a lovely stay!"

        "review_text": "Excellent services, Tunisian specialities with every meal  infrastructure and sumptuous garden, luxury! super clean hotel friendly and welcoming staff. Housekeeping: no complaints the hotel is running at less than 10% of its capacity, so it is empty (did the Ramadan period scare tourists?), so we are extremely pampered! There are two small comments, though: 1° hammam and sauna not hot enough (incidentally on the 4* beach orange trees nearby, it was the same,  2° to enjoy the entertainment why not post a program in the 5* for sports or evening services of the 4*? which would avoid having to leave the hotel, iron the gates, take a piece of road then enter the second hotel again, this being not practical we could not see what the animators were doing in the evening. The heated indoor pool is certainly more pleasant to 4* (sea view and it is less the oven than in ours, whose water is above 34 °!)  At this time of Ramadan, businesses are closing earlier than usual, which is the one and only drawback.  We took a few excursions: - Hammamet (the old medina): bof... let's say it's the real Tunisia! ....(not the universe of our 5*) - 10 dinars one way or return by taxi, we get a lot of seaweed! - Hammamet Yasmine: a nice clean medina, this one is worth a look (10 dinars one way or return by taxi) - Sidi Bou Said; not to be missed, by privatized taxi 50 euros the half day, a drink with coffees of delights: 2 teas with raw almonds and small piece of cake (12 euros), a good memory! and not excessive. - Nabeul market on Friday morning by privatized taxi 50 dinars: not to be missed, here we are in the authentic! -Show Sheherazade: great and worth it. Thank you all.  Cathy er Eric room 1204 from March 15 to 22, 2025. I will keep a very good memory of this hotel, and will not fail to praise it to colleagues and relatives!"

Admittedly we feel the \"low season\" side because some schedules are not respected, the buffet is a little limited and some services uninsured (lunch outside the lunch, no snacks etc ...)  The staff is lovely contrary to what we could read. Special mention to Lamia and the gentleman of the evening shift who pampered us.  Our room was very nice.

Service almost non-existent in February and limited buffet. No ice cream, no dates, no fresh mint, no snacks between lunch and dinner. Pool bar closed already before time. Oven off and no pizza for the little one, no cream for on pasta.No table set outside at lunch, forced to eat inside. We tried to have a Mojito in the evening but since it didn't have mint, we couldn't drink one.   Staff at the reception unpleasant. The agency had confirmed that we could enjoy the 4* which is part of the same The Orangers directrion but we were kindly sworn in as it was impossible to have meals in this hotel where we could eat out near the beach.  The PVC slats in the hotel aisles were broken and we could have hurt ourselves.  Access to the panoramic terrace by the beach was not prohibited while slats were missing on the access steps. No mattresses on the beach. It's like the hotel is still closed. It is better to take the 4* hotel cheaper and offers more services than the 5*.  Agencies have no knowledge of the change in the management of the hotel which was taken over by the son and this hotel has lost its prestige from a 5*"

This is very sad compared to the super bed 2m wide located a few meters away. Of course it was necessary to claim for this \"bed\" to be put in place. Always on the room, being forced to claim every other day for bathroom towels is painful. The large glass door did not close (8103) on a security plan is not great but in winter it passes. Leakage of water on the ground when using the shower.  I specify that this suite was otherwise perfect with a nice view of the sea. This hotel is fantastic, I don't know if there is another this quality in Hammamet. Very nice staff, quality restaurant, unlimited drink even at the bar.  Summary: almost perfect!"

        "review_text": "I have just returned from a stay at the hotel \"Les Orangers Garden Villas & Bungalows\", an establishment that boasts 5 stars, but unfortunately does not deserve them. Here is a detailed look back to help you make an informed choice.  Pros: Infrastructure: The hotel is visually pleasant, with well-kept gardens that bring a beautiful atmosphere. Service (in part): Special mention to Mouna at the reception, to the bartender by the indoor pool, and to the young woman who prepares pizzas. Their dedication and professionalism deserve to be recognized.  Cons: Rooms and facilities:  I opted for a deluxe room, but it did not meet my expectations at all. The elevator was dirty, which is unacceptable for a hotel of this standing. To access the indoor pool, you have to leave the room block, which is impractical, especially in winter.  Bar and choice of drinks:  The bar is a real disappointment: very few choices (only one wine available!), no basic cocktails like mojito, and the quality of drinks on offer is poor.  Restaurant:  Hygiene: This is the most shocking point. Mosquitoes invade the dishes, and I even found a dead fly on a cake. Unacceptable! Meal quality: The dishes are bland, very small in quantity, and of undignified quality. Breakfast is a disaster and dinner is even worse. I had to eat out to get a decent meal. Understaffing: One chef for a whole restaurant, which leads to endless wait times.  Lack of activities:  If you are looking to enjoy entertainment or activities, pass your way. This hotel does not offer anything interesting at this level.  Management and Customer Service:  Following numerous complaints regarding hygiene, meal quality, and service, the butler showed no responsiveness or commercial gesture. Yet we were there to celebrate a birthday, and he was perfectly aware of our discontent. The butler eventually acknowledged our criticisms but, instead of acting, he simply asked us how he could help. Managing customer satisfaction is his job.  I am a connoisseur of luxury hotels in Tunisia, and this is the first time I have seen such a gap between expectations and reality. I strongly advise you to look for other options if you want a real luxury stay with good products and service to match.  Final note: 2/5 (for infrastructure and some staff only)."

Comfort is there... with just one downside for me. I was just coming to cool off. I had asked for a room with balcony or terrace (= garden level). I had my garden but perpendicular to the reception car park.  So from 6am (or much earlier for departures excursions or airport) we hear the staff arrive, deliveries, buses arriving or leaving, taxis. It's not a big deal, but for a non-city girl who's come to seek calm, it's a pain. Especially since above I have young people whose heels walk (I asked nicely if they could be careful, but hey, we don't do it again)  So if you want absolute calm, I don't know which rooms to ask for. I was in the 1006.  And for people with reduced mobility it is not very well thought out either (noticed and confirmed by a holidaymaker that it bothered)  However, remember that the hotel is worth its price."

Drinks were also super all original imported drinks also the cocktails were mega.  Room was clean and top modern.  If you are looking for peace and quiet you will find here as hardly any music or animation is played.  Super service on the beach and at the night bar ( Skander) is the best and friendliest waiter who is looking for him will find him:-)  All in all the staff are very friendly and always eager.   Less good: Too bad we found that with this class of hotel unfortunately there were no welcome drinks what we knew so far from many other 5 star hotels and there you can really follow something.  Since we arrived earlier, the hotel was not attuned to us and we had to wait longer than even normal.   Unfortunately no hotel management or briefing on site (where, what is and when etc.... ) but only when you have asked.  Service is super just unfortunately too few staff for what is offered.  In the restaurant, the coffee or teaspoons were used up very quickly ( small amount ) and most often you won't find any.   All in all, a sweetly meant 8 out of 10 points.  Would we come again? I think so:-)   Thank you very much"

So those who criticize him think of the price paid. Cheap, you can't expect luxury.  Certainly it is rated 4 stars but it was at the time of Ben Ali, now it is the state that took it back and therefore made with the means of the board. Meals are good, entertainment every night (karaoke, mousse evening, fakir...) You have to bring your bath towels back, do not expect to have them. The beach is very well maintained but unfortunately it is 1km from the hotel.  This is the third time I have returned because at the price paid it allows me to spend a week in this hotel and a week in a luxury hotel."

You have to get off when the elevators want to work well. We remained stuck in the elevator which could no longer open. We had taken the all inclusive but difficult to have cocktails and impossible to have ice cubes for 3 days. C was reserved for the bar d next door that paid him. The waiter served us drip and I had the impression that the rum was cut with water. Alcohol is not served in front of you so no way to check. In terms of food it is correct but quite spicy and quite repetitive."

The mattress is Rock hard, obviously done for cheapness as will last longer being like a solid brick. Our backs where done in. The balcony slippery in rain be careful if over 6ft tall as rail low. The Bathroom oh my word Bath painted with massive cracks in it. Stained badly,  taps from like the soviet union 50yrs ago. Shower head had bits hanging of it like slime, I had to take of and clean under hot water was disgusting.  Walls in Bathroom filthy , I had to do top mirror dust test OH MY.  Toilet rolls and holder probably from the 50p shop rubbish. As for tv if you didn't get an old box one. Waste of time one English channel called 2, with constant Arabic adverts. AS FOR FOOD if you want the world's worst breakfast try it. Boiled fried or omlete best they do. Bring you own tea bags, and I am NOT joking.  Hallways etc upstairs filthy red carpet and old style net curtains. Filthy and hanging of their rails.BETTER THEY TOOK THEM DOWN.place needs a major overall. Pillows where flat as pancake. Had to ask for New ones. I would never come to this hotel again. Not even for £100 a week seriously.  And it can be very cheap, as lady there was there for £200 for the month, with flights.

I paid for a massage of 1 hour but the masseuse did not touch my feet once, if it disgusts your feet you have to change profession! Eyebrow hair removal she depilated me with a razor, blow-drying she botched me and left me to finish alone at the straightener so much it was swollen, they laugh at you!  Don't waste your money!"

        "review_text": "Returning for an umpteenth time to Mediterranean thalasso golf for a stay of 05 nights from May 19 to 24, a hotel I frequent since 2010, but this time I was shocked and surprised by unworthy and discriminatory behavior on the part of the reception for refusing me the all inclusive formula (all inclusive) that I booked as mentioned black and white on my booking voucher 1110805679 made on the stayforlong booking site under the pretext that I hold an Algerian passport. With this opinion I call on the management of Mediterranean thalasso golf in this case Mrs. FATEN MANKAI KSONTINI to take the necessary measures and directives so that this kind of behavior will not recur for a good image of the establishment and tourism Tunisian as well as the hospitality of the brother Tunisian people. Regarding the hotel ,like my previous opinions nothing but nice things to say: Hotel very clean to the last detail. Clean room redone every day. Delicious and varied catering  Two clean outdoor swimming pools  Green garden and dance  Not to mention the kindness and politeness of the staff especially those of the restaurant and bar Yasmine. I hope at my next stay in early October 2025 that this kind of behavior will not be repeated for a quieter vacation than this one. Semani kamel room 10038. Attached is the booking voucher."

From the entrance of the hotel which begins with the security barrier then by the reception staff and all tradesmen present in this Hotel no negative remarks are to be made. The more I have been granted a small privilege that I keep hidden but of great emotional value. Thank you, Mr MOUNIR. I greatly appreciate Mademoiselle NOUR always smiling for the communication between the guest and the hotel. I don't count anymore but my stays in this hotel for 20 years. As some Directors said: You're at home here. Well, I think so. Our stay on 2 plus a 4 legs was only happiness. Good continuation in all these improvements."

        "review_text": "Felt the need to review after reading some negative ones! Just returned from 10 days here with EasyJet holidays. Lovely hotel. We had a refurbished room, one of the ground floor bungalows. Very nice room. Only issue was the hairdryer is one of those old fashioned ones in the bathroom. Not very good. I recommend you take your own if you want a good blow dry! Lots of work going on to update the hotel and gardens. Quiet pool lovely in beautiful gardens. No issues with getting sun beds. This is not an adults only hotel although not many children.Staff were lovely and no problems with us being English as some reviews have suggested. Waiting staff in restaurant particularly friendly. Shame they have no names on their uniforms. The food is what you would expect in an all inclusive hotel. Fruit, cereal, cheese and meats with bread and pastries at breakfast and eggs any way you want. Some interesting local dishes. However if you want a full English breakfast you will be disappointed. Lunch and dinner similar. A couple of stations with freshly cooked meat, usually Turkey escalopes but sometimes steak and king prawns. Always pizza and pasta as well as local dishes. Lots of lovely salads. Best desserts we have ever had! Well done pastry chef! And lovely ice cream. Wine very acceptable, I liked the rose and my husband the red. Spirits came with Schweppes mixers. We ate once in the a la carte. Set menu and no choice but lovely food. Nice to be waited on. Good entertainment in the bar in the evening and hotel next door if you want something livelier! Four pools including one indoors. We visited the Crocodile park which was interesting and taxi ride cheap! Some shops selling designer copies -bags, T shirts etc. just outside the hotel. All in all a lovely holiday."

Welcome and service: Perfect nothing to say warm staff with quick check-in, quick response to our request.  Cleanliness and maintenance: Clean room impeccable linen and towels.  Clean common areas.  Well maintained garden and swimming pool.  Comfort of rooms: Comfortable bedding , standard size room, wifi present in the rooms.  Hotel facilities   The hotel has several swimming pools including a setback saltwater pool that I personally prefer. The hotel also has several bars and restaurants with a livelier side to the Djerba Aqua resort hotel and a quieter side to the Caesar thalasso, I find it interesting, we are not bored!!  Catering: Frankly varied and good catering it's hard to say the opposite. Snacks available between meals.  Internet connection: Stable connection but medium speed, enough to browse and send emails.   Value for money: Very good value for money for location and services   Overall experience: Very pleasant stay in an idyllic setting. Ideal for relaxing in the sun special mention to the bartenders of Caesar Thalaso (men and women),   Only the receptionist at night called Fatah who almost ruined our stay, this gas should not work in contact with people , it is not courteous to say even mean, but except that we made very warm encounters that made our stay very pleasant.   We will be back with pleasure."

The Venice is a man-made hotel, where you feel right at home, it is friendly and the staff is caring for you. The on-site massage center is cheap and the masseuses really professional (I have tested about thirty centers for several years)  Maye, Jean Mouloud, Tigana and Zizou are really super nice! The rooms are spacious, and the wifi works very well. The bathrooms are a bit old, but very clean and we still have hot water. The buffet and smaller than in very large hotels, but it changes with each meal lunch, evening and the next day. You can go there with your eyes closed, as a couple, with friends or alone, you will not be disappointed. Like what, 5 stars or 3 stars, in Tunisia, this is not always a criterion to look at. Look especially at the reviews and especially the most recent ones. Have a good trip to you and enjoy on this little paradise island. Bruno"

The evenings are varied and the music adapted to the atmosphere of the moment.  In short: it feels good. I'll be back."

Beach very close. 5km from Midoun and the crocodile farm. 10 km from Houmt souk.  Nearby activities: quad . Buggy. Horseback riding and many more ... The excursions offered are excellent. Especially the 2 days in the  Desert....we dream all awake! Animations every night have great animators. Receptionists 1 Listening and really very friendly and who gives very juicy advice on your to future purchases. The least: no fridge in the room, water is paid despite the all inclusive package. Breakfast without fresh juice squeezed, drinks of all inclusive served in cardboard cups. Burning neighbors but it's not the hotel's fault! We keep a beautiful memory and I recommend."

The food is quite varied even if it is quite spicy, the morning coffee is not crazy the cappuccino is good. We made the excursion over 2 days in dessert it is amazing. We enjoyed every other day the massages and hairdresser on the last day. The beach is great and the street vendors stay away. There are shops nearby to buy souvenirs for those like us who don't know how to trade at the souk."

Little downside the shop manager insists (or even heavy) and the person for the Inn's tour purchase becomes unpleasant in case of refusal.  We will gladly return to this property."

        "review_text": "We went for a short break to Hari beach club and i wasnt expecting much due to prior reviews but in all honesty it wasnt that bad. At the end of the day you get what you pay for and at £400 all inclusive for a week this place was worth it.   The rooms were clean and air conditioning worked perfectly. Food was a bit the same each day nothing amazing but nothing too bad.   I must say during my time here the staff were excellent especially Dali who worked the tables bringing drinks out each night and Walid the waiter during meal times - they went above and beyond what i expected.   one tip i would give is use the indoor pool we used it everyday when we was there and we were literally the only people in there!    outside of the hotel there isnt much to do so we decide to do the 4x4 berber village tour on offer by easyjet - it was a long day and the tour was given in French so you couldnt really undertand much of what was going on but one of the other guides in a different car on the tour spoke english so he could inform us ( i would just note this when booking tours as it wasnt explained to us by the rep that it was the case so we had no idea at all in the berber village when another guide took us around what was going on - and at £320 for 4 of you its a bit disappointing and then you get a meal when you are there and the manager there started to shout at one of our group because we wanted to sit together not have 4 people split between other tables )    We then decide to do the Pirate ship tour ... if you have every done one of these abroad before its nothing like them ... it was so bad it was good ... honestly go book it and find out for yourself   all in all it was a good holiday just to get away and switch off ... would i visit again maybe the staff and entertainment were great ... the rooms and food were good.   p.s tip the staff 10 dinar here 20 dinar there its not a lot of money but its makes a big difference to them"

Lifeguard is very professional at his job, helpful with local knowledge and very friendly. Bar staff are fantastic always smiling happy to help, fast at serving. Thank you to Dali (bar staff) for helping my disabled mum all week. Reception staff are very helpful and welcoming. Restaurant staff are very hard working and are happy to help with anything you need. Cleaners and maintenance keep the place clean and tidy. I’ve had the time of my life and not once did i ever feel threatened or unsafe, there was no inappropriate behaviour towards me as a young lady, like i have experienced in other countries. We were here at the same time as a serious accusation was made towards a member of staff THIS IS UNTRUE. As a family we witnessed what happened and came forward with our statement of what we believed to be true. You do not have to worry about anything."

My Room is right on the beach and lovely to sit on the patio reading a book with a coffee with the view (pic added) staff are very welcoming and friend and nothing is to much bother for them. Food is very varied and there is always something different and new on the menu every day. Ice cream bar at lunchtime is a nice touch you don’t see in a lot of hotels, always 3 or 4 different flavours to choose from and it’s proper tasty not cheep rubbish. Room are real nice with TV shower fridge freezer. Local shop about 4 mins walk is great for snacks to keep in there. Shop on site is a bit over priced and was warned by others before I went in there so didn’t bother.  Read a bad review below about a woman getting dragged to the beach by staff. Believe me IT NOT TRUE. The guy was a bullsh&tter. The woman in question was actually being helped by 4 members if staff taking her to the front entrance to wait for the ambulance after she fell and broke/fractured her leg while drunk like she had been for most of her stay. DO NOT let this review put you off. It’s a lovely place and i will most definitely be coming again later in the year. I sincerely hope this puts your minds at easy about whether to choose this lovely place right on the beach."

We'll say there's kelibia beach in summer and another one out of season  So summer customers ..and winter customers who do not receive the same service  A big disappointment apart from the paradise beach and the kindness of the staff  Tiny quadruple room (two children and two adults) a single closet no places for our things stayed in suitcase.. looks like in summer camp ...I made a claim Suites not available cause hotel half not exploited due to lack of guests 🤔😀 Buffet what to say... Not worthy of a 4 star... Not good not varied ... Big disappointment  No entertainment for children ..reason the season has not yet started...🤔😀 You are warned ... in off-season you are guests like no other summer ...."

Food in my opinion very good, the dinner buffet much more varied and higher level than that of lunch, very rich breakfast for all tastes.  Small beach compared to the capacity of the hotel, given the low season we have always found a place on the beach without problems but I think that in high season it is a real struggle to grab the gazebo with sunbeds and this could negatively affect the stay. Same for dinner out, in theory the table should be booked but being in low season there was always room for everyone which I do not think is possible in August, this is a great shame!  The animation guys very good and easygoing, engaging but never intrusive.  ONLY negative note mattresses and pillows, very hard mattress and pillows of very low quality, I highly recommend the property to provide because they are really bad. Very nice sea."

We stayed from September 9 to September 23, we start from the wonderful sea with a white beach and comfortable sunbeds with gazebo. VOTE 10  During the day you never run the risk of getting bored, given the various activities carried out by the animation team, we personally enjoyed the Beach Volleyball and Beach Tennis tournaments organized by Diego, but during the day you can also choose to play games on the beach. Water fitness, bowls tournaments and more  Thanks for the chat Andrea and Camilla.  VOTE 8  On the excursions organized by Veratour , we recommend the very beautiful Carthage one with a super-trained local Guide , while with Faid and Ciro you can choose an excursion from the hotel with camels , horses and buggy to visit the fortress .  VOTE 8  Inside the structure if you want to relax there are a spectacular massage center, we have done 8 total at a super honest price 20 € per massage  VOTE 10  Holiday just to remember for all these exceptional things, the only drawback that could improve to get to perfection, the kitchen quite repetitive in fourteen days with a few dishes to my taste good, you saved the first of the Italian chef made at the time and little else.

According to the website, half board would have cost only €9 more – so we thought we could book dinner spontaneously if necessary. Unfortunately, the hotel has charged us an incredible €45 – five times! This is absolutely unjustified and a clear rip-off for us. There was no response at all to our request to adjust the booking accordingly or at least to find a fair solution.  Unfortunately, the hotel also leaves much to be desired: Cleanliness was poor, especially the pool – sandy and unkempt. Overall very disappointing. For us this was the first and last stay."

Since the presence of this service was known on the hotel's website, we asked the receptionist who was very annoyed but indicated where the pool was. Arrived in front of the entrance we found it closed with a deadbolt despite being fully functional. We asked for clarification and we were not given any answer except that of an orderly who tried to call the attendants to activate the service but received no answer. The receptionist didn't give a damn and let us know not to insist. If you like indoor pools don't go."

First guy at check in was completely unhelpful giving instructions and info on hotel and town. Then we asked for one shampoo and had to wait about 45 mins to then get a shower gel instead. Eventually at breakfast the waiter was EXTREMELY RUDE and made us feel very uncomfortable. We wanted to finish our sandwich in the car as the driver arrived and in front of other hotel guests sitting in the restaurant he screamed at us treating us like criminal and forcing us to sit down to finish it. In my entire life I’ve never experience such an uncomfortable situation and nobody has ever spoken to me like this. We were two young girls on a visit in Tunis and the fact that a man shouted in this was chasing us to the door entrance is something I really do not want to experience anymore. So if you are a group of girls traveling you might want to think twice before booking because there is a VERY STRONG misogynist component here.  Only the lady at the reception was able to understand us and offered later on a snack box but this does not excuse the lack of respect. Thankfully we only stayed one night."

No phone service in the rooms (the telephone was there, all sticky but no tonality) the tv was not working (a small broken box was there with half of the buttons missing, and no single channel is there, let alone a remote)I can go on and on and on. And i swear i'm not exaggerating. One and only thing positive i could say about this hotel is how nice and helpful the reception people and all the hotel employees were and that I guess is true for all tunisian people in general. Internet wifi was free in the lobby area so at least that was there. I went through all the reviews and I was extremely surprised how people cld like this hotel, seriously !!! i was even angry coz i relied on those same reviews to accept such a transit hotel by tunisair. So either this hotel has reallly deteriorated since their reviews or its only lies or maybe we are speaking about a different hotel, coz the one and only el oumara at rue ali darghouth looks like to be an abandonned property. Please people be objective and honest in your reviews other are relying on them."

Beautiful nature around the hotel, great swimming pool, beautiful beach and sea just few steps from the hotel.  But the best part are the people in there! I felt very safe. They were smiling all the time to begin with reception manager and cleaning ladies. I've never met so many nice people! Animators were great, so positive and so kind ♥️ There was activities like aqua gym, archery, darts, volleyball, dancing, show every evening and many other. You don't have to leave a hotel because there was also few shops in there. I agree with others that this is 3* hotel, for sure not 4. It needs good renovation. But it is spacious, clean and I saw that whole staff was doing their best. My special thanks to Animators: Miro- the sweetest young man I've ever met, Amine who motivated me to go start to work out again, Mario- best dancer 🫶 and Kimo, Tigana, Youssef, Tchitchou ❤️❤️❤️ Big THANKS to bartender Blaid Ayadi- very kind and good person ♥️ I'll go back there for sure just for this people and the atmosphere! 😊😊😊"

The staff was not really attentive, I felt quite…anonymous, if you know what I mean.  I had an impression French people were having the most attention and care from staff. During my 5 days stay there was at least one time when I went to a dinner and I could not find a place to sit, I was walking around with my plates and no one cared about this, even if the waiters saw me looking for a table.  Food was okay for me, most of it was quite tasty, I was not hungry. But margarine instead of butter... I’d expect more.  The real highlight of my day was melon served during lunch time - it was the best melon I’ve ate ever.  Room was okay, furniture could be newer, everything could be cleaner. But it wasn’t the worst.  The beach was nice but I feel like it was dirty, I’m not sure what was that but I think there was w lot of camel poop in the sand. Sunbeds should be changed for sure.  AC was working but it was not the strongest.  All in all, I’d like to come back to Tunisia but for sure I’d look for a better hotel."

Breakfast was ordinary to say the least- like a low budget hotel. I pitied the people with all inclusive meals.  I had one beer - it was flat!

        "review_text": "For my part, I don't understand the disastrous reviews with a Rating of 1/5 \"to run away\" that scared me before Check-out... We had a great family holiday and it would be quite possible that we would return to this Inn in the future!  First, you must remain objective you are in Tunisia not in France! A 4-star there is not a 4-star with us. Then you are on an all inclusive buffet at a reasonable Award so you necessarily have quite simple dishes.  However starting from these two points we enjoyed our meals, the buffet offers a lot of choices and almost homemade. The only downside comes not from the buffet or the staff but from tourists who take incredible amounts to make a lot of mess and who often cut the queue in front of those who wait.. Review for us: Inn clean, appreciable meal with superb surroundings, sea and pool view room, very spacious pool, friendly staff, lots of friendly meetings on and off site. I recommend the small shop of Mohamed and Sami both extremely honest and always available for a nice discussion purchase or not.  Leaving the Inn take the sidewalk in front and on the right \"the Mediterranean\" on google = Center of natural Tunisian Spices and \"Tunisian Crafts\". Of course, our review is up to us, it is obvious that everyone's feelings are not the same in our experience and expectations, as can be seen clearly from previous reviews. Nevertheless I take the time to write this review because for us this Inn certainly does not deserve the mention \"to flee\" and we hope it will reassure other people who may have been afraid to read some reviews like this may have been our case."

        "review_text": "Wow! This word should capture your attention and the entire holiday impact upon us due to the STAFF. The staff are utterly incredible. Their warm, attentive, helpful, friendly, passionate and dedicated approach to their individual roles at the hotel is a compliment to everyone of them. All animation staff, waiters, cleaning team, bar staff and pool attendants. If your looking for the personal touch, wonderful and creative food with fabulous taste and creative displays, this hotel offers the lot. Accommodation, location to the beach, swimming pool which is like the blue Lagoon, DJ Simo :-) ......of my goodness, where to start and finish. For a true holiday experience, look no further than this hotel. You will not be disappointed at all. The animation team will turn strangers into friends, and that includes you becoming friends with the team. Book now, you will have regrets. Already about to rebook ourselves. Thank you"

Darts, french bowls, yoga, water polo, aqua aerobics, so many activities and the different shows they do in the evenings are brilliant too!

        "review_text": "Our second visit to this wonderful hotel in two years, we were still impressed by all of the staff from the gardener up to the Manager, many who remembered us from last year.  There has been one or two changes which in our mind has spoilt the bar area, it is now like a sports bar, fine if you want to watch football 24/7.  The rooms are a little bit tired but are cleaned with the towels being replaced as necessary. The beds are comfortable but oh dear the  pillows ..... very lumpy they need replacing. The shower, which is very powerful, is over the bath which in itself isn't a problem but would be better off with walk in showers.  The dining room is very good because you are allocated a table which you keep for all of your stay, saves having to search for one.   The food wasn't as good as last year, not as much variety for the main course, lots of chicken (over cooked and dry), the meats were not carved just pulled apart and put on your plate.   Fresh fruit not as plentiful as last year.  In our mind the best meal of the day was breakfast, plenty of variety and omelettes to die for, cooked to perfection.  Waiting staff are very good no complaints at all.  Pool area always kept clean and there always seemed to be sun beds available even after people had put their towels out early.  The beach area is fantastic, with life guards and security in attendance, the security guard will take your towels and find you a sun bed.  The beach bar is a nice touch where you are served by friendly staff, nothing too much trouble for anyone.  Having mentioned the food quality it wouldn't stop us from revisiting as this is a first class hotel."

All of the staff are super friendly and very helpful. We felt at home from the moment we arrived at the hotel to the second we left - we didn’t want to leave!   I’d like to give a special shout out to mido and his animation team for making our holiday experience so enjoyable, they ran activities throughout the day including: darts, bowls, table tennis and water sports  and had great shows and entertainment in the evening for all ages! They are the best team of people and made sure we always had something to do and were always checking in on us.   The food was very good, and the restaurant was a nice calm atmosphere, it was a buffet and had lots of choices for breakfast lunch and  dinner (I am a picky eater and there was always plenty options for me)   The a la carte meal which on coco beach (part of the hotel) was delicious - I have added a photo of the menu for this!   The rooms are clean and spacious too! We didn’t have any complaints - we went as a couple and had a gobble bed as well as 2 single beds in the room with a nice balcony.   Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff!   There is a bowling alley down the stairs from the hotel - this does cost extra to use as it’s not affiliated with the hotel but it is very cheap! Ans a lot of fun - the animation tam held a bowling competition there on Tuesday and all the holiday makers had a blast!   Amazing hotel 1000/10 me and my partner have already booked to go back next year!"

The hotel is clean, the staff are amazing, the rooms are comfortable and the quality of the food was far, far better than expected. My wife is coeliac and was well catered for but you can’t get gluten free bread in Tunisia so take some with you if possible. Sure, there were some nights I didn’t fancy most of the food on offer but I always found something good to eat. The pizzas are amazing. Our main waiter, Faycal (Faisal), was exceptional. The facilities are well run and amenable - Bars, pool etc…. The entertainment team are also great, not pushy and like a bit of light hearted fun. The staff in the main bar, brilliant and funny. They say you get what you pay for. With this hotel you get MORE than you pay for. So many guests have stayed here on multiple occasions and I can understand why. Ignore any negative reviews, as this hotel is brilliant. My wife and I travel regularly and this is one of the few hotels that we would seriously consider revisiting."

Staff are amazing especially the animation team that go above and beyond to make you welcome and entertained without any much pressure. Food is generally typically all inclusive but the desserts are fantastic. They are really trying to upgrade the hotel this year and its just made it better there. My only thing is the night reception guy. Never gives you the correct exchange for your money and doesn’t issue a receipt. It wasnt a one off as he did it last year as well. The day reception guy is so helpful and genuinely lovely. There are too many staff that are fantastic to name individually. But the cleaner for room 3045 was amazing and all the little towel animals and flowers she left in our room made our stay extra special. Hopefully see you next year xx"

We were 3 friends visiting and we were disappointed with our room, so a quick visit to reception and the brilliant manager moved us to a pool view room at no extra charge. Brilliant service. You are allocated a table for the duration of your visit which is great and saves time searching for an empty table, your waiter will get to know what you like to drink and bring it over. I needed soya milk in the mornings and this was quickly arranged and then bought to me daily. Thank you. Security on the beach was great, it just stopped the sellers coming up to you, police patrol on quad bikes as well. The whole beach area from the bar, cocco beach are kept spotless. I recommend the pizzas, made to your request.. we didn’t really partake in the entertainment, choosing to sit in the bar talking. The only downside for us were the drinks. The cocktails were weak. Great if you drink wine, beer, gin and vodka, but it did not spoil the holiday.  We got a taxi to the market. 20 Dinar each way and worth a visit. Remember to barter as they like you to.  A tip. Change your Dinar BEFORE you go through security as we thought we could spend ours in duty free but had ours confiscated.  I would recommend this hotel and would visit again. Well done to all the staff"

The complex is very nice and clear, located on a wide sandy beach - ideal also for families with children. Special praise goes to the entire team on site. They are all in a great mood and highly motivated. The positive energy is really contagious. I would particularly like to highlight the guest relations Pauli, Steffi and Veronika, who really live their job and try to read the wishes from the lips of all guests. The food is very good to sensational - always fresh and varied. There is something for every taste. Very good also the barbecue in the beach restaurant (for a fee) a very special atmosphere. My highlight of the sundowner at Café Maure. Cool live music with delicious cocktails and nice conversations. The evening shows are on a high level and you can feel with how much passion and commitment the participants represent them. Compliment! As a repeat offender, all I can say is: I will definitely be back!!!"

All chairs are equipped with plastic cushions that stick to the butt and mostly high chairs. - The drinks, including wines, are all terrible. - The shows are fine, but we've seen much better at other Robinson clubs. Luhana was especially weak. - The Hawaiian evening meal had nothing to do with Hawaii. - The mattresses were quite hard. - The archery field is not usable in summer. There are hardly any shadows."

        "review_text": "Very nice Pension, excellent catering with a large selection of well cooked and presented dishes. All sorts of sports and outing Things to do, there is something for everyone. The rooms are minimalist, no storage drawers, no decoration and tristounet furniture. On arrival the receptionist did not speak a word of French, she was German and the exchange was therefore made in English... I had booked a sea view room, but the one we were assigned overlooked the inside of the blocks. At the reception I was informed that they had not had the information from the tour operator... Another receptionist (who spoke to him French...) found us a room with sea view, but as the Pension was supposedly complete, we were on the ground floor, in a family room which was certainly larger, but whose sound insulation leaves to be desired. We could hear our neighbors when they were in their bathroom, as if they were in our own room!! Nevertheless the facilities whether beach or pool are up to the standard, I recommend the beach restaurant and the beach bar (special mention for Mabruk, efficient and friendly waiter). The only really negative point was the 99% German customer base, if we had known that we would not have chosen this Pension. We have been to Djerba several times and generally the clientele is cosmopolitan, but this club is not to be recommended to the French, some German clients do not seem to appreciate our presence and make no effort to speak, even in English. Even the manager, German, did not seek to discuss with me in English. Fortunately the Tunisian staff were happy to speak to us in French! The very few French or Belgian speakers we met felt the same way and told us that they would not come back either, despite the quality of the Pension. I submit this review so that tour operators selling stays at this Pension mention that it is a German club for German family customers."

        "review_text": "It's probably the worst Robinson in the whole chain. The rooms are rather simple, uncomfortable, dark and full of ants. The food is always buffet, although almost everything is rather tasteless. At 7:20 p.m., everyone storms into the dining area and secures the tables. If you arrive at 7:30 p.m. on time, you won't find room. When we decided to book wine and dine places, we were presented with the wine list. Consistently Tunisian wines for 30-50€. All were created from the vinegar category. This situation is intolerable! Every evening the party music resounds from the bar into the rooms. Sleep is unthinkable until 1 a.m. The whole thing then culminates in the arrogance of the reception, who doesn't care.  What was outstanding: the Nautic School for sailing and childcare, where Ellen and Anne are to be mentioned. At Letizia's and others' house, my child wanted to be picked up. Employees generally only move against regular tips. Robinson really needs to think about whether they want to keep this club going. Apart from the Roby Club and the sailing school, the whole hotel needs a new coat of paint and a change of management. In no case is this club worth a Recommendation"

        "review_text": "We have been avid Robinson travelers for many years and were as a family with our 15-year-old son in August 2024 on a summer vacation in Djerba Bahiya.   We noticed that there was no usual \"coming home\" at this club. I.e. it took us longer at this club to arrive and arrive. Until the end, we missed the classic Robinson charm. Whether we will go to this club again, we do not know today.  But there were also many POSITIVES: But what we can say: As always, we met great people and enjoyed special moments.   What you really have to give the club is the varied sports offer with really TOP coaches.  A special thanks goes to:   Tennis coach \"Emmy\" -> Always in a good mood, top organized + attentive and courteous. If you want to make progress in tennis, you must book a coaching lesson with her. Or 2 or 3 :-). Emmy is a coach with a passion for this sport.  Water sports coach \"Mirja\": Daily changing program with a changing music playlist and a lot of good mood + motivation. It has been clearly noticed that Mirja gives qualified lessons and has a lot of experience in this area. And best of all: All exercises were also feasible and effective in the water. Highlight was aqua jogging in the sea. One of those Robinson moments :-)  Mindfulness trainer \"Janin Stötzner\": A special experience for the mindset, your own attitude... A coach with experience and a lot of sensitivity and an incredible charisma. Thank you for this experience that even our 15 year old son loved.  And what stands out very positively are the very striving and courteous staff in the service + the small, beautifully assorted Robinson shop with a great special offer. Worth a visit!"

        "review_text": "We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful dar in the heart of the medina. Indeed, I cannot imagine that you will find better lodging in Tunis. I've stayed in many places in many countries, and this is among the very best.  Room: I believe there are four rooms altogether, one of which is an apartment. We made a point of reserving the blue room well in advance, and were glad we did. Gorgeously appointed and embarrassingly spacious, we felt like royalty. The bed was firm (which I prefer) and very comfortable. The shower is small but adequate, and the water pressure and temperature were excellent. There were plenty of electrical outlets. The room was well insulated from noise overall, although, it being spring, at times one could hear the sounds of cats wooing in the alley below.  Location: Perfect for exploring the medina, with several cafés and sandwich stalls nearby. Personally, I would strongly recommend staying in the medina, which is atmospheric and surprisingly peaceful. Though it was pretty easy to locate via GPS, we were glad we booked our taxi through the B & B, as the medina is a bit of a maze and most drivers won't take your directly to the door.  Staff: The owner, his wife and the staff were unfailingly cheerful and friendly. I texted the owner several times with questions, and his responses were prompt and helpful. My wife developed a medical problem, and he was kind enough to arrange to have a doctor/acupuncturist come to our room. Thank you, Marouane.  Food: Breakfasts were spectacular, with different options every day, most of them homemade. We were given access to bottled water as needed, and were able to buy glasses of wine."

Very cool domed ceiling with groovy chandelier Lovely bathroom, ample linens, tons of blazing hot water and great water pressure. Some sewage smell on and off (pretty typical in these ancient homes) solved by keeping the bathroom door closed. The breakfast is unbelievably ample, delicious and varied. The husband and wife hosts and the two ladies who work with them are all completely lovely, attentive and helpful. Great location inside the car free medina. I cannot say enough good things about our stay and would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you!"

        "review_text": "I recently spent 3 nights at La Chambre Bleue. A charming guesthouse in the heart of Tunis medina.  The owner Marouane arranged a taxi for me and the driver brought me to the door. You'd struggle to find it alone.  My room was one of those pictured with an arched ceiling. Very pleasant and atmospheric. Complete with it's own patio. Note that the bottle of water provided is from the tap and whilst it won't kill you, I wouldn't have drank it had I known in advance.  Communication in advance was excellent. Marouane speaks excellent English and was quick to respond. So I was surprised on arrival to be greeted by a woman who did not speak a word. Marouane does not live there. This was not a big problem but if you speak zero French then you might not be entirely comfortable. But then if you speak zero French then you're going to struggle to travel independently in Tunisia. M was almost always available on whatsapp and came and had breakfast with me on the first and last mornings.  The house is super charming. He's refurbished it and wants to have cultural events there. Breakfast was varied with traditional type items. I would perhaps have preferred eggs, cream cheese etc (which I got other places). The lady running the place was very nice, despite the language barrier we got by on a combination of my bad French and google translate.  It's worth noting that food options in the medina are a bit limited, and they close pretty early. I survived on the snacks I'd brought with me on the first night as everything was closed. It was only around 6pm. Even worse on Sundays. It's not the most tourist friendly medina (thinking of Marrakech, for example). Make sure and save the location of the guesthouse on google maps. When the shops close and the lights go out you might struggle to find your way home.  La Chambre Bleue is undoubtedly a top choice for your stay in Tunis medina."

        "review_text": "We were fortunate that when we contacted Sondos that she had the Makhazen room (with the cross-vault soaring ceilings and a column) available.  The room has a private courtyard and is very spacious.  The bathroom is quirky (no door) but functional.  The walk-in shower is a small alcove but as there is no shower door or screen it does not feel cramped (nor did the bathroom get wet!).  Breakfast is served upstairs in the dining room.  There were significant changes every day but constant were an outstanding juice (prune, peach and banana), yoghurt, black bread toast, ricotta and a large array of jams and honey plus coffee/tea.  The girl service breakfast and making our room was so delightful!  Breakfast was served from 08:30 and we never had any appetite for lunch afterwards!  Sondos arranged an airport pick-up for us which was nice as La Chambre Bleu is located in the Medina.  However, the Medina is compact and we never had any issues finding our around.  Be aware that the shops close early 17:00-17:30: then the souks and the Medina are dark - phone flashlights are useful as rubbish goes into the centre of the ‘street’ for removal but is likely still there when you are walking back to your room at night.  We never heard any external noise when we were in the room which made for excellent rest.  Sondos provides us with a great map of the Medina with restaurants, cafes, and sights to visit which simplified getting around.  A fabulous base in a wonderful, underrated city/country.  Highly recommend."

Although we managed to find an attractive price offer, there are some things that you should not turn a blind eye to. Cleanliness in the room, in the canteen and toilets does not exist. The pool bar is located right next to the stinking public bathrooms, from which a terrible stench is extracted. I feel sorry for the bartenders who spend their days there. Despite leaving tips in the room, it was never cleaned anyway. Food is a failure, monotonous and tasteless, sometimes with a strange, disturbing taste. Whether we came to the opening of the canteen or later - it was always cold. In the cafeteria, mess, sticky tables, leftover food on the floor and tables, all in all everywhere. Sometimes at lunch there were still those from breakfast. Great chaos in the queues for meals, sometimes even fighting for priority. As for the beach at the hotel, it is wide and sandy, with a gentle descent to the sea but unfortunately littered and could easily be cut. The water in the sea was extremely clean but it could not be perfect here either, because on the shore there is a lot of rubbish, probably thrown by the sea. Lots of flip-flops, bottles, filters, foils, etc. Sunbeds on the beach free of charge, if you succeed you can also put a metarac on them, but you have to hunt them because there are fewer of them than sunbeds. The pool at the hotel is a little too small for such a large number of people who can be in the hotel at the same time. Animations mainly for children, we will not judge because we were a group of adults themselves. Plus for the reception staff - very helpful both during the problems with air conditioning and organizing a taxi to a nearby town."

You had to fight and scramble like in the Far West to reach the food, raided in absurd quantities by local families, who then abandoned it on the tables without being able to consume it because taken in quantities truly beyond imagination. The staff was constantly bringing in new pans of food, but a couple of local customers were enough to empty the whole pan. Small local children ran around the room without any parental control, touching and licking the food and tongs of the buffets. Some local children tasted the sweets and then put them back in the buffet. The European clientele was stunned and could not believe that they had ended up in such a hogwash. The staff, always kind, witnessed what was happening, made us realize that they agreed with us that the situation was crazy, but did not intervene in any way and just watched. After a complaint from us and other Italian customers, the management and the chef admitted that they were not able to cope with the situation, but they gave us their personal willingness to let us have the food personally, which was not necessary because in the second week, probably thanks to the start of school, local families drastically decreased and this made the situation much better and we finally managed to eat with peace of mind managing to access all the available foods. We have been visiting Tunisian hotels for over 30 years, we have always enjoyed it, but we have never been in a similar situation!!! The local customers sitting on the lobby chairs (often soaked in water by those who sat in their costumes still wet) with their bare feet resting on the tables we had never seen them anywhere. I would say that this is an unsuitable structure for European customers if that is always the case."

As we my partner and I have previously stayed at this hotel we knew it was a good place to stay...but upon arrival this year the refurbishment of reception area with new lighting and seating was fantastic it's really lightened up the surroundings there.   Then we can talk about the restaurant refurbishment.. again it's been done to very good standard with bright furniture colours and paint  throughout and all new cooking facilities, bain Marie pots ,soup pots ect. Food great and something for all...if you like any sort of egg for breakfast like us ..we took a bottle of hp brown sauce which others liked us to share haha. During our stay we had large cooler cups which were filled when required but a couple of days before our departure signs went on bars stating no large cups could be filled.. but if you order 2 beers and pour your own in its ok... this is not to get drunk before anyone says anything..this is something we've done on other holidays but it wasn't an issue.   There has been a lot of comments with regards to this being an Italian biased hotel.. so here it is for English or other europeans who visit this fabulous hotel.. the Italian bias as people call it is something that guests need to understand.. yes there is an ITALIAN ANIMATION TEAM...this hotel has been selected by an an Italian tourist company called BRAVO.. they are there to ensure there guests are catered for.. Alice and Roberto run there animation team and are good with English..maybe some of younger team are not ...but a couple of simple words bonjorno or ciao will help cross that barrier as they are a great team..then when you are lucky enough to stay here there is an international animation team.. so after Italian presentation of acts or entertainment you get told in English, Dutch, French German by the international animation manager who is also good.. the animation team's in this hotel are brilliant  so come with open mind get involved in darts,  archery, boules ect and have a brilliant time at El borj"

The hotel foyer was very spacious and comfortable seats all around, the bar area was at the back of the foyer, with doors out on to the veranda Drinks are limited local variety if you wanted anything else there was a small charge, and not self service and small glasses. The veranda had more comfortable seats and tables with large sun umbrellas over, The pool was large with sun-beds all around on the grass (ants were a pain) could always get a sun bed. The rooms were large, and clean ours had a balcony that looked out to the sea and road below, only moan about this is that the balcony had a board that run around the inside that obscured your view when sitting out, yes rooms are dated and need a bit of TLC, floor by bathroom lifted due to bathroom flooding, towels were a bit grey but they were changed daily and clean, we had a fridge but no kettle, Restaurant was clean and service from waiters amazing,  Adam for breakfast and wajdi for our evening meal both were fantastic and looked after us well,  We always found something to eat, not many English dishes but plenty of chicken,  salad, and chips, Breakfast was typical continental hams and cheeses, there was a lady making omelettes, pancakes, fried eggs or doughnut rings, my partner asked for boiled eggs and these were done daily no problem at all Shopping we found a mall with items already labelled and you could go into the shop with no hassle ( right out hotel, first right, left and a little way along also opposite) you could browse and were left alone, found smaller local shops aggressive and rude if you did not buy anything.  Would be return yes for what we paid it was a very relaxed break away"

Mariem was great always got us involved and made us feel welcomed however the hotel needs to spend more money for entertainment. No live evening performances and during the days limited entertainment. Ramy was also great, very welcoming too and always came to see if we needed anything.

        "review_text": "To escape if you like cleanliness!! Dilapidated rooms and cleaning not done, we arrived in a dirty room! We changed rooms three times. An embarrassment to a so-called 4-star hotel! Very strong bleach smell mixed with moisture, many return trips to the reception with slow elevators because the room card does not work after a while (forced to go back through the reception to re-magnetize it). The food was not up to our taste, but it remains subjective! Others liked it, it takes something for everyone. Non-subjective reviews: dilapidated rooms and shameful cleaning. The facilitators are very kind and do what they can, but we haven’t seen any daytime entertainment. Maybe in May it is quieter... We arrived on the wrong weekend because many locals were there and it was clearly a mess! It’s not the hotel’s fault, though. What is the fault of the hotel is the cleanliness, the problems of elevators, room cards, the handle of the door of our room that remained in the hand, the rust in the bathroom, the flooring horribly laid, the simply disgusting floor in our room! The hotel has not been sufficiently renovated for a 4 star! A slice of pizza as a taste for all inclusive is very light too... A review remains subjective, people less looking at cleanliness will tell you that it is a superb hotel and other people like us will really not be happy! It’s up to you to see but big downside on the cleanliness of the rooms and the renovation of the rooms that is far from finished! The hosts and Ahmed very nice, the hostess of the reception very nice at first, but in the end it got worse... We will not go back to this hotel!"

        "review_text": "What can you say about this hotel? First impressions are lovely. We got there had to wait two hours for our rooms. The rooms are very old and dirty. Me and my friends stayed here for two weeks. We had one lot of clean towels and our beds was changed once  the whole time we were there my room never got cleaned but they cleaned the balcony which I could never understand. it had one bar open and are limited drinks I asked for bottled water to take to my room on many occasions. I was told no. There was no snack bar in the day they put a tray of food by the bar. there’s no fridges hairdryers in the rooms. It is nothing like the pictures on the Internet all entertainment is done in the nightclub where people are smoking and children do their mini disco. It’s absolutely disgusting. It’s not disabled friendly and if you find steps hard to go up and down this place is full of them and if you complain about anything, you don’t get anywhere it says all inclusive but it’s not because you’ve got to pay extra mattresses for the sunbeds are five dinar a day that’s by the pool and on the beach the bar by reception, you have to pay for drinks if you want to have a drink there. Most of the staff are nice some of them are really rude they asked you for cigarettes. Even the guards on the gates asked you to get them cigarettes when you go out of the gates to go to the shop. We were sat by the pool there was work going on they were painting doing things round the pool. It wasn’t a relaxing holiday. The entertainment team are really good. The only thing is there’s a few of them that spend all their time pestering young girls which isn’t very nice to see. I would not recommend this hotel. It’s the worst hotel I’ve been to in Tunisia."

We checked in just after 11pm and was taken to our room we have 4 bed and a flat screen to with a balcony. Room was clean only had to ask for towels. Next morning went for breakfast and the omelette was amazing. Coffee machine was awsum. The staff in restaurant was always on the go any wanted to please everyone. They set up a lovly table and made a cake for my hubby's bday which was lovly  Pool side always clean The beach was amazing Food was good Staff polite If only 2 things I think they should improve on would be more variety of drink on the all inclusive And more entertainment especially around pool area.   Also think there should be free ice cream for people during the day.   Other than that had an amazing time would decfo recommend for a budget holiday. I will deffo be re visiting.

We are all tired & stressed by this time !! When we came back they had sorted out rooms for us 🤣 well if that’s what you can call them !! They were dark and dingy smelled of smoke and damp we were all split up all over the complex!! No wifi in any rooms only the club !! Which was an inconvenience as we couldn’t contact anyone!! We complained about the rooms and miraculous they found us 4 rooms all together!! They we expecting a 2 year old to sleep on a bunkbed with a hard tiled floor no offer of a cot !! No fridges in rooms to keep drinks cold !! And the rooms & tvs very dated and didn’t work properly nothing like the brouchures  advertising the hotel !! The food was diabolical it was meant to be multiple choice it was repetitive and vile !! We asked for water on more then on occasion and got refused until we complained!! Especially as you have to use the water to clean your teeth etc !! We got told we were drinking to much !! The whole complex was a disaster from start to finish !! The entertainment of an evening was in a carpeted room and you could smoke in there it was disgusting 🤢 all inclusive means you offer food throughout the day this was not the case !! There was a limited bar too !! Beer wine of vodka nothing else unless you complained!! Definitely a waste of money we will not be going back!!!"

        "review_text": "The worst holiday we have had!  To start when we arrived it took over an hour to check in to then be told they need to find the rooms we booked. We were then told to go eat while they did this.   We go to our rooms where we were far away from each other. When going into the room it smelt of damp, they were filthy. It hadn’t been cleaned it looked like someone had used the bath, the pictures when booking look nothing like what we was given, in one of our friends rooms there was mould in a bedside table. We then got given rooms as near each other after complaining. In the new rooms one of the showers was broke and was still filthy.   The food choice is very limited and repetitive. Barely edible and always cold.   We paid for all inclusive and was refused water on more than one occasion after complaining and telling them I will be posting this all online they have basically tried to bribe us they made us a table with a birthday cake and on another night they made us a table with a bottle of vodka and nibbles as one of our party posted a poor review.   Half of the amenities were closed, the ‘club’ where they did the entertainment was filthy and just smelt of smoke. There was live light wires just hanging out the wall. We asked for our rep to come to the hotel and he didn’t even bother showing up.   On one of the evenings a 2 year old shut himself in a room and they didn’t want to know, it took them over 30 mins to even open the door.   In one of the rooms there were bugs in the beds and all over the floor.  There is no wifi in the rooms, only in the reception.  They ran out of glasses and were giving drinks out in small paper coffee cups. There’s live wires sticking out the ground and walls. They have slides here and told us they are under construction but another worker told us they don’t even have a license for them.  Management really needs to look into the poor reviews as it is diabolical here.  It really is not worth the money to come here.  I’m awaiting a response on getting a refund."

        "review_text": "First thing we see in the room was the toilet leaking always making noise, the tv didn’t work and the balcony door didn’t close all the way.  So they moved us to a different room and this room was not much better. The rooms in the photos on the website are completely different to the rooms we have seen. They say it’s all inclusive but you have to pay for icecream and sunbeds. And if you want to play football in the courts you have to pay.  The bar there was so poor that you had to walk all the way down to the main bar just to get a drink, because they don’t want to open the bar up at the pool yet. And the drinks you have come in a little plastic cup like I’m a kid.  The food here was not the best, most nights we had to eat out, just so we could eat. We fully understand traditional food, but there’s kids and people with various allergies etc, typical simplistic food would have safised.  When the cleaner come in to clean the room they moved all of are clothes around. Like don’t touch my stuff.  Overall, not satisfied and won’t be returning the pictures used on various holiday websites of the hotel/rooms etc  are very deceiving.  Slides aren’t open due to not having a license for it which isn’t stated prior to coming, why show them if you cannot use them?"

This year the food although traditional Tunisian as always was by far better than last year which is great. The hotel rooms are basic but perfectly suitable, the water is hot and the rooms cleaned everyday.  The whole hotel is constantly being cleaned and maintenance staff always doing stuff within the grounds. The activities available tennis courts, basketball, beach volleyball etc. The animation team are pleasant and very engaging ask people to get involved with activities of which they try and do things all day.  The evening entertainment was the same as last year everyday something different but after 7 days they repeat again and it hasn’t changed a lot since last year which was a little disappointing but won’t stop us visiting again. The staff of the hotel are second to none always looking to please, the bar staff are great and we have made a few holiday friends for life in a lot of the staff.  We will definitely be returning next year. It may be a 3 star hotel but has 5 star elements"

There are shops that are a 5 minute walk from the hotel if needing essentials etc. We got a tunisian sim card which was 42 dinar for 25gb of data so you don't need to use your UK sim as can be costly. The bar staff will bring your drinks to you whilst your at the pool which I thought was great! The staff are very helpful and polite including the waiters etc. Food here for us was excellent and reached above my expectations for a 3 star. If your looking for chips, chicken nuggets then don't book here as everything is traditional food. They have a pasta station and a pizza station if you can't find anything to eat. Desserts are lovely and for us we enjoyed the food. I can't fault this place and I'm sad to leave. Alot of the guests we met have booked 9-10 days here. There are jet skis and paragliding on the beach if you want to do some water sports. We went out for dinner a couple of times to the hard rock cafe which is a bit like TGIS and have entertainment there also. Its a 10 minute walk from the hotel. No issues or problems whilst we have been here and I would definitely recommend if your looking for a cheap getaway. Please do not book if your looking for 5 star with a 3 star budget!

Never seen him the whole holiday. Food was mostly inedible.. and mostly not warm. The cleanliness of the dinning room was not great, out of date hygiene certificate on display. Staff , it was a 50/50 split between nice and grumpy. I know id deffo be grumpy working there. Even shop keepers in near by shops said it was the worst place, that they only open for season and close again, they don't put money back into the hotel or area. Has totally put me off the country and dont think I will return. Which if every body done this would not be good for tourism in Tunisia. Only good bit was the beach, it was beautiful"

The reception staff is arrogant.the security guards are noisy at late or very early hours.The rooms are not soundproof.old and uncomfortable bedding not to mention bedbugs.the catering is null, very limited in choice and repetitive not to mention the poor quality of food. No wifi and air conditioning in the rooms.to go to the beach you have to cross houses and a puddle of sewers to get to rocks that I will not call a beach at all. This Inn does not deserve a star!!"

        "review_text": "Very friendly hotel if it was maintained what a pity...because lovely staff throughout the Inn little wink at Sam (restaurant) and Nabil ( secu ) great people ... The rooms are in very bad condition and the cleaning is very very minimal dirty and stained bath sheets broken and rusty just like the taps, completely different from the lobby of the Inn where everything is very nice. The Pension is perfect. The food is good but always the same especially when you stay 15 days. The private beach is really not possible the same on the whole coast around the Pension you have to go further on Nabeul. Big black spot when you are with children, really a shame especially when you see that some employees throw their cigarettes on the sidewalks when they should respect the place for their customers. Really hard to have clean places around. Suitable for the Award."

        "review_text": "The pictures from the offer do not correspond to reality. The pool is small, the beach is not like the pictures, there is no beach bar either. The beach is as dirty as a garbage dump. The offer states that there is a Fitness Club and animations, but none of these things are available. The rooms are very dirty, the cleaners do not clean as they should. The air conditioning is moldy, they only speak English in the hotel, the Internet does not work. The view from the window is of garbage cans."

        "review_text": "Noise  Hotel too noisy, especially the dog who barks all night and the housekeeper on the 3rd floor who is unpleasant and rude who makes too much noise by shouting loudly in the corridor. The cleaning ladies violently slam the doors.  Restaurant  Late opening of dinner 8 p.m. always 15 minutes late The meats are not cooked: they look like plastic. Very little choice and lack of taste  The dishes are cold even the soup is cold   Household   Can do better   Security  A very senior security officer is not very friendly with customers: his other colleagues are more friendly with customers  Beach filled with pebbles and rocks  A nice swimming pool  Hotel that has aged badly and some unpleasant people who ruined our vacation.  Reception  You have to call him several times for the same technical problem because he doesn't call the technical service, so you wait for nothing. Service that leaves something to be desired, especially in the afternoon and evening."

Breakfast offers a wide choice and the dinner dishes are very good. Given the deterioration of hotels in Tunisia, the management of this one seems efficient and selects its customers. It is hoped that this will continue over time. A small downside however: The wifi is almost non-existent in the rooms and works irregularly in the common areas."

The bed sheets were all stained pretty hard to sleep in such circumstances... Very unfortunate because apart from the room it is a good hotel. The little extra is the bar where you can enjoy the evening by the pool."

        "review_text": "My opinion is without fuss or exaggeration. So the cleanliness leaves much to be desired (dirty floors and traces of stools in the toilets) after this is Tunisia, nevertheless our sheets were clean and the bed comfortable (note: double bed = 2 beds pushed together) The night guards were great, the poor ones don't have a lot of fun even though they are just employees, the problem is the managers who don't really care about customer reviews, the swimming pool is pleasant when there is no too many people, the breakfast is not great, the orange juice is sachets diluted in water, the milk is the same.. the rest is correct. In terms of parking, don't expect us to have space easily, the popular places are reserved for the boss's colleagues who come to drink in the evening ;).. No wifi in the rooms, that’s true! And French channels yes but only 4 or 5. A LOT of noise, people don't respect anything, speak loudly, slam doors violently and often and we were extremely lucky to have work done above our room! 👍🏻 It's a 3 shooting star hotel, I've spent better nights in ibises in France which don't have any stars.."

The pictures are not representative of what is there. The patio door was unlockable, clearly been forced. The bedding dirty. Some sheets had blood on them. Cracked tiles on the floor and in the bathroom and the tap ran brown water. The beach was desolate, dirty and the beach hut a now broken down uncared for shell, to get to it you would have to cross a stretch of land littered with rubbish and occupied by stray dogs. There is more, but this should be enough to stop you going."

        "review_text": "This hotel is horrible, It matches nothing to the description. The spa for the hamam was closed during the full two weeks of staying there. As soon as we landed we had to wait 1and half hours to get our family room. We weren’t shown around the hotel no one assisted us with taking our luggage up. The lift had gotten stuck whilst inside it. We finally got used to getting around the hotel. The only good thing about the hotel was the cleanliness around, the cleaners were good at doing there jobs. Some of the staff were lovely. However some of the staff were very very rude...I mean I’ve been to better three star hotels. We requested a fridge and paid for it and received it a whole week after renting it out. We then received it and the plug wouldn’t fit due to the size of the fridge. The fridge was absolutely disgusting. The rooms are not child friendly there are many health and safety hazards. The electrics are hanging down from the phone there’s cracks in the floor tiles. The door has no lock on the terrace. I can not stress how much of a rubbish hotel this place is!!! If your going on holiday with children this is not the place to stay. Tunisia is a beautiful place and in fact it’s my 7th time staying in Tunisia but this hotel is absolutely disgusting. There’s no entertainment for the children. It’s just not a hotel you’d want to stay at. The food is terrible everything about it is just horrible."
