Reception staff very friendly.  At the lobby bar, Mahrez was amazing and helpful.  Also a shout out to Khaled in the breakfast dining room.  Knew my coffee order and brought it to me every morning.  The reason I gave four stars out of five, are the on site restaurants.  If you like fish/seafood, you’ll be very happy.  For those of us that are vegetarian, not many good choices.  I felt the menu in the lobby bar had more choices at better prices.  Not within walking distance to the Medina,  The hotel arrange for a taxi to drive us and wait for us.  Overall, a pleasant stay."

The hotel itself exudes luxury in every detail, from the beautifully appointed rooms to the impeccable amenities. Everything was designed for relaxation and comfort, especially the spa.    A special thank you to Sourour, whose outstanding service truly elevated my stay. She was attentive, warm, and consistently went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect throughout my visit. Her professionalism and kindness didn’t go unnoticed and made a lasting impression."

It's a shame because the facilities are luxurious and very lovingly assembled, but the service does not allow to have that 5* service that you would expect. The catering could be much better matched to their prices. People in reception and those responsible, much more resolved, but the service in general, uncoordinated."

The most extremely pleasant: the spa scents from the entrance and in all the corridors. The bathroom with the old-fashioned \"full red marble\" decoration keeps all its charm, it is also really well supplied with cosmetics/hygiene and accessories. Room service is very attentive, fast, discreet. The bedding is a real plus. Very nice. Unfortunately, televisions are not set up in smart mode for modern use... the rest being so positive we go over it. The breakfast self is perfect with excellent waiters by profession. The Tunisian elegance we love. The variety and quality of extra products.  The outdoor pool had just been put back into service, it unfortunately took too many days to heat up for us to enjoy... The spa on the other hand, with the beautiful seawater pool, and absolutely wonderful! The hammam is great, the sauna too. Nice staff. The small fitness room is functional (still lacks enough to clean even the appliances, hygiene is a concern since the staff cannot be behind each passage). The hotel enjoys a lot of outside passage, either by subscription or dinner... this affects the attendance but less than others, and the hotel remains family and well attended. In conclusion: A nice stay."

The indoor pool was the particular side of the residence. the see water comes directly to the pool with a warm temperature and its very comforting. i guess the hotel managers should mention this option more . because we haven't know at the beginning and one of staff told us there. totally the pool area was absolutely welcoming with herbal drinks and several spaces for relaxing. thank you guys. The breakfast was clean fresh by enough kinds of food related the guests taste.  Thanks Ms. Olfa for managing and observing the whole situations there.  the hotel lobby is so spread with historical and beautiful decorations by fully hosting of the staff there.  You can find different kind of restaurants like Chinese and local foods inside the hotel by fine quality.  Rooms are big clean quite with a high-speed WIFI    _ I guess this kind of residence is not suitable for children and gets boring for them and  vice versa is excellent for couples having relax in a luxurious atmosphere of this hotel.    Thank you guys for our peaceful moments there."

Thanks to Bomba and Chocolate; just communication about activities could be easily improved:   the application of Internet activities is useless since it is not up to date; the schedule should be updated daily (near the facilitators' shed): example: you learn only 5 minutes before there is a spinning class (indoor cycling) , the same for the bike ride; you are aware of the Arabic class only by word of mouth, too bad because these activities are interesting. Personally I would also have liked a few short walks in the hinterland and a little more Arabic music. In any case thank you for everything!!!"

Although Sousse was not really my kind of place more for beach lovers I think, it was compensated by the wonderful hotel experience.  The staff were very helpful, for example,there was a noisy nightclub facing our room and the staff changed our room immediately.  The food was excellent and caters for everyone. If you are into beach holidays then I would recommend this hotel."

But what really made a difference was the exceptional attention of Mrs Lobna, who took care of everything with great attention to detail. Thanks to her, we were able to enjoy our stay with complete serenity, without any inconvenience.  Ms. Lobna embodies the patience, kindness and professionalism of a true manager. There is no doubt that one day she will hold a senior position in the biggest hotels, in Tunisia or elsewhere.  Congratulations and thanks again to the entire Mövenpick Sousse team for an unforgettable stay."

We booked a 3 person room and it was so narrow so we wanted to upgrade it.. they said we dont have any suites and we had to pay an extra room.. yet there wasn’t any information spreading around the staff and when we was in the restaurant for dinner every one had to ask the same question about the room and the dinner.. we explained million times and at the end they bring the check with extra dinner to pay!  The AC was not working and we had to call for one hour till someone came to fix it They had planned an external event on the weekend in the afternoon while people where there to relax in the spa we had to head the crushing of ceramic and screaming of the attendees of the event!  The AC during normal days wasn’t working in the restaurant until this event was held so they opened it when visitors came!  We asked for a cup with ice and the waiter said the soda is already cold why do you need ice!! Everyone was hating themselves during serving dinner!  It was truly a shame .. only those two kind workers .. We definitely will not be back"

A huge thank you to Noordine for her kindness and attention to breakfast: I felt like a princess every morning, pampered with a big smile. Samia's sfenjs? A real treat, a crisp and gourmet happiness!  Chef Brahim introduced us to the art of sushi with passion and pedagogy — a moment as informative as it is convivial. And what better way to sip a cold drink served by Ali, under the generous sun of Sousse? Finally, a big thank you to Siham, always attentive, who ensured my comfort in the room with great sweetness.  A team with little care, a warm and rejuvenating setting... I leave with a light heart and memories full of head. Thank you for everything ❤️"

Another perfect option to entertain yourself is the Fitness and the classes. Nour - the girl who runs them, is positive, very kind and gives you the maximum for every class. I tried the Pilates, Belly dance and the Arabic lessons - all of them were funny, interesting and if I had more time I would try every possible option on daily basis.   The food at the restaurants is great, the rooms are big and clean, the lobby is classy.   I highly recommend this place."

An absolute gentleman, nothing was ever too much, his service the year prior made us a repeat customer again this year.  Selmine - Movenpick Restaurant, full of knowledgeable suggestions for places to visit/dine outside the hotel.   During the week we never once had to fight for a sunbed, the pool bar staff were attentive and kept the cocktails flowing.   As part of all inclusive we got a free meal in one of their restaurants. We cannot recommend Sendai Sushi more, it was phenomenal. We went back a second time for Tepinyaka, what a show!   With love from the Isle of Man 🇮🇲 thank you for making our stay."

Perfect. Thanks to him and his team because he really made our days very pleasant. Bravo.  Only downside: it is necessary to know that smoking is allowed in the bar of the Spanish restaurant, so you risk dining in a tobacco smell + a \"responsible\" dined among customers and allowed himself very unpleasant comments about the employees, without any embarrassment or discretion.

        "review_text": "An excellent hotel,we stayed for a week in mid-May and found the room of a good size with a nice view and very well kept by the very friendly housekeeping staff. No complaints there. The hotel itself is clean,the staff are friendly and professional,food was excellent although the buffet restaurant gets very crowded at times. We didn't use the pool as it was too busy/noisy for us but it was well attended and the animation team must be commended for their efforts there. Loungers were good quality and looked comfortable. This is a hotel favoured mainly by French tourists,we were one of very few English/British travellers but we encountered no issues and only a minor language barrier and we had a relaxing week with no issues.  The only thing that would stop us returning (and this hotel is VERY good value for money) is the state of the beach beyond the hotel area. We recovered glass,fragments of roof tiles,building materials,clothing,footwear and endless amounts of plastic. In all of my travels I've never seen so much plastic on a beach. From an environmental point of view it is horrendous, we are not eco-warriors but we care about the sea and the environment surrounding it. This really needs addressing,we've never seen anything like it and over miles of beach it was a similar story all along (this does not at all reflect on the hotel which is well maintained). Otherwise if you like a pool-based holiday in a nice place we would highly recommend here."

        "review_text": "First time at this hotel. Firstly there's no bell boy to take your cases in to the hotel so we struggled as had 30 kilos each. And it's large cobbles. Animation brilliant. Had lots of fun with them. Loved each and every one of them  Rooms small. Food good but often cold and fridges inadequate because you could literally pour the margerine on your rolls. No loaves of bread provided unfortunately which is a shame. Staff great. Loved bar waiter in evenings.  Never waited for a drink. Men's toilets were often flooded and out of order. You definitely need an extension lead as only 2 sockets ( one was for the lamp). Had to ask for kettle twice, then weren't given cups so had to get them from bar. No tea or coffee provided but we took our own. Beach towels ok but small. I bought one from a shop. Overall if these issues were ironed out I'd definitely return because the Animation and staff were absolutely brilliant."

        "review_text": "Would really recommend staying at this hotel. All the staff are really friendly without exception! All of the animation team took the time to speak to us which we haven't experienced before. Entertainment was always fun of a night. The location is a bit out of the way but no problems in getting a taxi if you don't want to walk. There is a good choice of food available. The rooms are a bit dated but are spacious. What sets the hotel apart for us were the staff though."

        "review_title": "Very good hotel---- in depth review",
        "review_text": "There are many reviews on trip advisor for this hotel but many are a little vague and short mainly praising the entertainment team. This a longish in depth and totally honest review, so grab a cuppa and read on.  Located in Yasmine Hammamet and if you want to walk to beach its about 2 minutes away. If you want to walk to shops maybe 20 minutes away and onto marina it about 35 minutes away but is an easy flat walk.  Hotel reception is lovely, bright and airy and staff are pleasant and helpful, spoke good English. Gave us information on hotel, where things were and mentioned the al la carte options that were available. Plenty of comfy chairs in foyer to sit and watch world go by and place was spotlessly clean  I had emailed and requested an upper floor room in quiet area. So of course I was given a ground floor room close to bar. This was quickly changed and I got a room on 2nd floor overlooking quiet adult only pool  Room was fairly large and bright perhaps a little dated and maybe in need of updating. Few floor tiles discoloured and cracked.   Room was clean and cleaned each day along with clean towels every day  We had 2 large single beds, very comfy, a 32 inch TV with just BBC News in English. Shower in bathroom was powerful always plenty of hot water, but even with shower curtain in bath water still did go over floor at times  There is a small fridge in room as well as safe deposit box which was free to use  Balcony was a little compact but overall fine for 2 people  There was air con but at this time of year we did not need to use  FOOD  My wife is a fairly fussy eater but even she found plenty of food that she could take and enjoy. There is a great deal of variety of fresh food  Breakfast was some breakfast cereals,fresh fruit, yogurts, cold meats and cheeses, croissants, pastries as well as hot choices like sausages, potatoes, eggs, scramble, boiled and freashly made fired eggs and ommlette.  Lunch and dinner consisted of soups which were delicious, Tunisian dishes, chicken, beef, lamb,fish, pasta dishes, freshly made pizza,as well as cold meats, salads, fresh fruits. Grilled dishes were also freshly prepared including hamburgers, fish, chicken and turkey. Food was always hot or at wort warm, but never cold. Trays were regually topped up so plenty to go round.  The choices of pastries, cakes fruits and ice cream was excellent  POOL AREA  Fantastic main pool area with very large pool whic you could walk into with a very gentle slope. Pool area was typically 1.2 metres deep going to maximum of 1.4 metres deep. There was a small separate kids pool.  Entertainment team would have activities on in and around pool area, water areobics, water polo was set up but not used.  Plenty of sunbeds to around at pooside as well as plenty of sunbeds in the grounds and tables and chairs in and around poolside.  There is a separate quiet adult only pool area with a 20 metre pool and around 40 sunbeds  The grounds of hotel were nice, lots of flowers, tress and grass areas, some of which were just being relaid  There was a separate kids club area and a small and new kids play area  Drinks, for us were all inclusive. water, coffee, soft drinks. Beer was served in mainly 300 ml glasses. Local spirits and bar staff were generous with their servings as well as coktails  STAFF  Overall standard of service was excellent, staff very attentive and always smiling. From Reception staff to bar staff, catering staff cleaning staff and the entertainment team.  Entertainment was OK, nothing special. A couple of shows, karaoke, bingo and quiz night. Entertainment team always encouraging people up to dance but not too in your face. During day there was archery, mini golf, darts and water aerobics.  Evening entertainment was inside at bar area. In better warmer weather there is a larger outdood stage where entrtainment would be held.  There are a lot of French hotel guests as well as Brits, a few Germans and some locals  NEGATIVE COMMENTS.  Minor issue, rooms are a wee bit dated.  BUT the big issue for myself and many other guests was one of the weekends, where I think half the population of Tunisia came to stay.  Dining room was absolute chaos with the Tunisian guests who took over the entire dining room. Very loud, agressive with terrible general manners. There were no tables to be had, but we got one eventually thanks to helpful waiter. Once seated, no cutlery, no plates and not a lot of food left. Tunisians had piled up mountains of food on their plates of which about half of it was left, therefore wasted. It was absolute carnage in dining room as if a plague of loctus has descended  We had this Saturday night as well as breakfast and lunch on Sunday, before they left.  NOTE  TO HOTEL.If you know you have a large number of guests arriving, or of hotel is going to be full, could you perhaps orgainse 2 sessions for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Overall an excellent 10 days and I would recommend this hotel.  If you want any further information contact me."

        "review_title": "Disappointing.",
        "review_text": "We are an older couple who stayed for 2 weeks from 25/4. Whilst we regularly holiday in Egypt this was our first visit to Tunisia for over 20 years and we were surprised to see the continuing level of abject poverty away from the tourist areas even though we knew that Tunisia is a poor country.   As we always do, when booking the holiday we requested a quiet room and when we checked in we reiterated this request.  Our allocated room was on the ground floor in 'block 2'. There were problems with the room which included 2 of the 4 lights in the bathroom not working and a broken lock on the french windows. Not good when the room was on the ground floor. All the problems were attended to quickly although the repairs were not all successful at the first attempt.  There was the usual music from the pool area during the day but it was quiet during the evenings. That was until the evening disco moved outdoors from 1 May. The noise was horrendous. We immediately requested a change of room and moved to 'block 4' the next day.  Without going into great detail, this is not a 4 star hotel. Whilst staff, with rare exceptions, are friendly and helpful it only lasts for as long as you tip (any hard currency is preferred to Dinars). The housekeeping staff work hard but we never saw a vacuum cleaner so cleanliness of the floors and rugs is an issue. (Don't walk around your room with bare feet, particularly after a shower!). Food in the restaurant was usually beautifully presented but was too often of mediocre quality.  Contrary to previous reviews, when walking into Hammamet and on outings we were not hassled in any way.  A couple of tips:  Taxis are cheap but do haggle and agree a price (usually at least half what they originally ask, often a third) for your journey with taxi drivers before getting into the taxi and try to have the exact amount for the price agreed. A couple staying at the hotel agreed a price of 5 Dinars and gave the driver a 10 Dinar note expecting change. The driver drove off with the 10 Dinar note (the amount he had originally quoted).  The hotel reception can arrange a car and driver for your exclusive use for the day. We used this service twice for outings to Carthage and the Bardot museum and El Jem amphitheatre and museum. It's cheaper than the offers available from tour operators and you go at your own pace. The drivers do not act as guides but know what they're doing, tell you what to look out for and take you to sites that are not included in the tour operators' offerings. You will have to pay entry charges. For all the sites we visited the charge was 12 Dinar each (around £3)."

        "review_text": "Got back today after our second time there. Some of the best service from all of the staff we've ever had in a four star. In fact the service just might outweigh some five star hotels we've been to. Everyone's very helpful and friendly and cant do enough for you. Superb cleanliness.   Good quality rooms, if a little dated, but in reality that's not a problem. All you do is sleep there. As I think has been mentioned before there's a lack of wall sockets so take a few adaptors if you have a lot of rechargeable stuff etc. Have to say that the large bowl of fruit and the towels on the bed every day as swans with petals etc was a great touch.  Fantastic animation team (Vicky is a real bonus) and some good acts as well. Bloke on the violin was stand-out! Bar staff are brilliant too. One failure though was one night the act due in the bar was moved to another room leaving those in the bar with out anything. Some music would have been good.  Be aware its quite geared towards French Tour Operators so don't expect lots of British there. Guess what? They don't bite!  If you're a fussy eater like me you might struggle with the food but I can honestly say the quality improving and I found something most nights.  If there's something to change/improve on its the meal arrangements when there's a seminar or a locals event happening. We were there last weekend and the restaurant was complete pandemonium and a free for all. If your a paying tourist and not forceful, and I mean 'forceful', you wont get near anything.  I have to say sadly that I've never seen so many people take so much when clearly needing so little. You don't need four plates of food per person, fruit, ice cream, cake, bread etc between two of you only to leave your table looking like a rubbish tip with uneaten food everywhere for the poor staff to clear up. Might want to give some thought to using another room for those that are not paying tourists.  So my advice is definitely book this hotel as the pros definitely outweigh the cons. We'll surely be back this year or next!"

        "review_text": "Had a lovely time with my mum, the staff were really great despite having a problem with our booking, the booking manager was very accommodating. The rooms were clean, not perfect but clean enough. The hotel was also very clean and tidy including the food areas and the hotel generally smells so nice. The food was great, fabulous choice and you can tell there’s very little food waste as they put enough for everyone and only top up when a dish is empty. There’s also 3 a la carte restaurants you can visit free of charge. We visited the Tunisian restaurant which was a nice experience. The entertainment/animation team were the best, day in day out they kept the vibe of the place high and kept everyone in good spirits and also took the time to get to know each and every single guest. The hotel is 5 mins from the beach and you can see the ocean from the resort, it’s a pretty view. The staff are so so helpful and friendly and that was a huge part of us enjoying our trip. We will be recommending this resort to everyone. Just 1 hour away in and around the capital, there’s lots to do and many excursions. We felt VERY safe in and out of the resort despite what people often say like it’s unsafe for women. From our experience, we felt safe all the time.   A few things to note: - The pool was very very cold even in hot weather so not many people used the pool. it would be good if they could heat it slightly  - The spa facilities were okay, not bad but not the best I’ve ever seen. The massages however were amazing, would highly recommend booking in a massage if not anything else. - During our stay there was a seminar of some kind, and the people attending brought their entire families to stay. They were not paying guests and caused much chaos for many guests including letting their kids touch all of the food on display, taking vast amounts of food (that went to waste) and filling up Tupperware containers full of food, enough to last a week. They were rude and inconsiderate and many many guests, including ourselves didn’t get to eat and felt very uncomfortable in the hotel. The hotel need to organise better. Before you go, ask if there will be anything like this happening. We spoke to lots of guests and everyone was unhappy. The standard of the food dropped, general hotel hygiene also dropped and guests were concerned about their belongings. This is the only bad thing."

Being an all inclusive holiday the food and drink are crucial to a good holiday and this hotel did not disappoint, the variety and abundance of dishes meant you can find something for all. Traditional, familiar all tasty and beautifully presented.  Although I don’t indulge in alcohol much these days the few I had were very good. Mainly locally brands.  Lifeguards at pools at all times and never a need for towels at dawn to get a sunbed The entertainment team are busy, energetic but not pushy. Many activities to join should you wish Our room was great, large, with a small balcony. By far the best quality were the staff, all levels were cheerful and friendly and very hardworking. A tribute.  Not as polished as maybe Spain, Greece, France, etc. if that’s your bag, Tunisia has had a rough ride for many years, but the best value you’ll find anywhere and the people inside the hotel and out are simply lovely.  A very safe and comfortable feel to the area I highly recommend this hotel"

All the staff are happy and smiling and are so friendly, nothing is too much trouble.  The lobby is great with a cash machine and welcome drinks.  Check in was fast and stress free, they have currency exchange too as its a closed currency.  You can pay the pool towel deposit in sterling so you don't have to worry about being left with Dinar at the end of your stay.  There is a small shop that has very reasonable prices.  A really massive shout out to the guys at the pool bar and the pool guards and sunbed guys, you made our holiday 'Very Gooood Very Niiice'.  I hope the ducks are living their best lives and I hope the  get to see this.  The pool and surrounding gardens are spotlessly clean.  An absolutely fantastic bunch of guys, so much so that we didn't go to the other pool......   We had a bungalow with garden view (214), our maid was so friendly and always smiling, the beds were made every day and changed whenever we requested, fresh towels every day, the room was spotlessly clean.  Mini fridge was stocked with water and soft drinks and there is shampoo, shower gel, hand soap and body lotion provided and a pretty decent hairdryer.  There are also dressing gowns and slippers provided.  We ate all our meals in the main restaurant we were so happy with the food choices and freshness.  The dishes were not repeated over and over like in some all -inclusives, its was presented fantastically and there was something for everyone.  A huge thank you to Ben the guys up around table 84, you made us feel so welcome and made it feel more than a hotel dining room.  Even though it could be very bust at times they were all smiling and we never had to ask for drinks, they appeared as if by magic!!  The staff here really make the place fantastic.  Thank you for a truly fantastic holiday!!  My partner never likes to go to the same place twice but he has already said he would definitely return here, so you may just see us again very soon (September.....)"

        "review_text": "This hotel is fantastic. The staff are all so welcoming and attentive. The hotel is about 50 minutes from the airport.   The room was a bungalow 204. It was large with 2 small doubles pushed together. The shower was really good and it was kept clean.   The grounds in the hotel are clean and tidy. Everyone says hello whilst they work.  The hotel has a well equipped gym. The pools are a good size and there are always plenty of sunbeds available. The pool boys were always there to lay out the lounger cushions for you. The waiters come around asking if you want a drink all day. The beach was also good and we swam in the sea several times.   Food, we were never disappointed with the food. We mainly ate in the buffet restaurant. Our waiter Walhidi was brilliant. He always had our table set and wine ready to pour. He was one of the most friendly people you could meet.   Staff, they were all great, the entertainment team were always friendly and would stop for a chat even if you didn’t take part in the activity.   Bar staff, they were exceptional, they all knew your drinks and would tell you to sit down and they would bring them to you. The attention was great as they would be bringing the next round before you finished.   Tipping was never asked for, unlike Egypt where everyone wants a tip. The staff here were never pushy or rude. Everyone had a smile and seemed genuinely happy. We did tip well overall the two weeks but it was deserved.   Overall a fantastic holiday in Tunisia. This was our first visit here and we never go back to the same place twice however we will make an exception in this case. Thanks to everyone at the hotel for making the holiday so good."

The staff remains the big downside. They are not smiling we always have the impression that they mock us. speak poorly French and very poorly organized. Fortunately the animation team raises the level and is very nice."

The food is decent, though it’s quite seafood-focused, which made the options a bit limited for me as I don’t eat seafood. One of the highlights of our stay has been the kids club. Our daughter absolutely loves it, and we go every day to see Rita, who runs it. She’s fantastic with the children and truly made our stay extra special."

The hotel is beautiful, we always book a room in the main hotel on the 3rd floor. We paid extra for a sea view which was well worth paying for. The food and service are always really great. Amazing  choice of food. Something for everyone.  I would like to say how good your Entertainment team are. They are all extremely friendly, informative and helpful. I’ve taken part in a few of the activities and especially like the Aquaswim, Pilates, Yoga and Zumba.  LaLa is a credit to your company. She always goes the extra mile in everything she does. She keeps us all full informed about the activities during the day and in the evening.  In the evenings the entertainment has been great. The team are always attentive and encouraging.  Thank you. Keep up the good work.  I would definitely recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "This is a lovely hotel and if my review was based solely on service received from waiters, bar staff, pool staff, the Animation Team and cleaners, this would be a five star rating. They are superb. Friendly, helpful, kind and professional.  The only department that did let us down was reception. We booked a two bedroom junior suite as we were travelling with my elderly mum. As we had a very early morning flight out, we booked a private taxi transfer to the hotel. This turned out to be unnecessary as although we were in the hotel by 11.15am, we could not check into our rooms until 2pm. This was our mistake. When we arrived, we paid the appropriate tourist tax for 3 people on a credit card. We were taken to our suite at 2pm and the first bedroom was made up accordingly for two people. However, the second bedroom had a half made bed in a room without a wardrobe, drawer, mirror or towels. I returned to reception to inform them of this but the receptionist insisted the room had these items and sent a porter up with me to confirm. Consequently we all returned to reception once he had seen the room. There was no apology. An hour later we were given another suite. The second bedroom now had a wardrobe and a drawer but no bed and no towels, just two sofas and a television. We also had 4 hangers between 3 adults for a two week stay. Eventually at 5pm I found bedding and we pushed the two sofas together in order for us all to sleep. Two days later a bed was made up in her room. We also ordered a hotel taxi from reception and had previously been advised to ensure the meter was on. The fare was 44 Dinar and the driver insisted he would wait for us to return to the hotel without a waiting charge. An hour later we returned directly to the hotel and he tried to charge us 174 Dinar. We paid him 90 and reported him to reception who confirmed it was a hotel taxi. A few days later, another guest told us they had experienced exactly the same treatment that day. The driver also continuously texted on his phone during the journeys and even held maps up in front of the windscreen while driving in an attempt to take us further. The food here is excellent but the dining room can be very busy and very noisy. However, all other staff we encountered were amazing and did everything possible to make our holiday enjoyable. Upon checkout we asked the gentleman on reception to remove our all inclusive bracelets. At this point he informed us that we had only paid tourist tax for four nights, not fourteen. This was not true. Tourist tax is also only paid for the first ten nights of your stay, per person, not fourteen. We refused to pay more and he dropped the matter. All in all, we had a good holiday but we were very disappointed by the service received from hotel reception staff."

The UK crowd was rowdy in the restaurant and lobby. Children could express themselves where I don't write an opinion now. The plates at lunch and dinner were overloaded with what then disappeared into the trash. It is a pity that this partly disadvantaged the holiday atmosphere.  Visited this hotel four times for the purpose! Back home, but this time it was not the case. It's too bad."

        "review_text": "We booked the hotel for the fourth time. First in advance maybe it was a wrong time from May 6 to 16. Never experienced such a noisy time in this hotel as in this period. It was crowded, In the restaurant it was a clatter of plates, sliding chairs and screams of jewelery. Our compliments to the staff who provided polite and optimal service. The food is excellent and versatile. This was also evident in many people from the lavishly filled plates which were later thrown away. (Definitely nothing used to at home). After 8pm it really started. Instead of enjoying a cup of coffee with a drink in the beautiful lobby, the screaming started with excessive children's disco violence. For dessert, the loud house pounding alternated with Miss hotel pageant or Drag Queen until 23:00. Past times it has been held outside or in another location of the hotel. Fine for the lovers but not for us. JAZ Tour Khalef a pearl of Sousse but this time the glass was far from there. About the hotel nothing to criticize service, friendliness no trouble too much this is really TOP. Rooms are neat, park and pool with stand is neat and everything with a top service. Too bad a beautiful location with all possibilities both the city of Sousse and surroundings as stand. But not for us anymore."

        "review_text": "This is not a 5 star hotel. It’s 3 stars. It’s a very basic all inclusive resort. Not luxury but if you are happy with that and set your expectations then you could have a great holiday here.   However based on other reviews that I read prior to going on this holiday. I’ve since understood why there are so many 5 star reviews. The hotel staff have a review day once per week and will come over to you to ask you to leave a review and watch whilst you do it - they also ask again at check out hence why there are so many 5* reviews. It’s not a very honest representation of the hotel. So here is an honest representation-   Hotel-   The hotel itself is nice. The reception area is grand and decorated well, incorporating the Tunisian vibe. However this changes when you get to the floors where the rooms are. Hallways are drab, carpets old, very outdated and you could easily get lost as the room number signs are not signposted very well.  We were on 5th floor at the far end of the hallway and above the staff entrance and beside the staff lift. It was very noisy from 5am onwards and our room/corridor often smelled of smoke from workers having cigarette breaks.   Staff -   For the most part, the staff were nice. I am a blonde female so noticed heightened attention and male staff wanting to converse more when my partner was not by my side. This made me uncomfortable but I wasn’t ever left on my own for too long.   Pool waiters were great. If you tip them then they will continue to come back every so often to ask if you need anything else. I did notice the complete difference when we did not tip.   At the Dining Hall. There was a lovely older man called Hassan who reserved a table for us at every lunch and dinner, as well as pouring our usual drinks for our arrival.   Food -   The food was very basic. The fresh pizza and pasta counter saved the day for me. However, that did mean I ate the same pizza and pasta everyday for a week and I wouldn’t describe myself as a fussy eater.  A lot of the time the food wasn’t labelled properly or in English, or at all. It was a lucky dip for what you were actually eating.  I had picked up what I assumed was meatballs and they were actually tuna balls. The utensils are also contaminated as they seem to share a set of tongs for a few different dishes. Worth knowing if you have fish allergies etc.   Drinks-   Drinks on all inclusive weren’t great. Local alcohol only. Cocktails didn’t taste particularly nice and were always too strong. The drinks menu was also very basic and it would have been nice to have more variety or even for the cocktails to just taste as expected. They seemed to have a strong chemical taste to them.  The option to even upgrade to all inclusive plus to allow nicer drinks would have been welcomed.   Entertainment-   The entertainment was pretty poor to be honest. Most shows were put on by the animation team, they seemed unorganised and were not particularly crowd pleasers.  The interactive entertainment such as karaoke, bingo and competitions were better received.  However, the hotel should definitely invest in the entertainment and spend more money to get outside entertainment in for a few days a week as after dinner time there is not much else to do.  If there was some music in the lobby bar then that would have made the atmosphere better.   Animation Team -   The Animation Team were always fine with me, but like I said - I was with my partner. I was made aware of issues that separate groups holidaying at the same time (young girls, holidaying without their boyfriends) had issues. They were pestered and felt uncomfortable by some comments and actions. They were cornered and followed by some members of the animation team and I’m sure there were explicit comments made to them. So this changed my view on the animation team as it’s a bit unsettling that they assume that behaviour is okay!  I’m sure this issue was brought to the attention of management at the time and nothing was seen to be done about it.   Although Freddie on the animation team was a sweet boy and I only ever heard nice things about him. I think the actions of a few members on the team are a liability for the hotel and that should be addressed.   Room -   Basic room, nothing extravagant but always clean and the maid always left a nice display with the towels and some flowers.  Annoyed that there was no air-con. One of the days was 34 degrees. We asked at the reception for our air-con to be switched on and were told it wouldn’t come on for anyone until 15th June. We later discovered this was false information and a few other holidaymakers got the air-con turned on. Which was annoying, as when you pay for a service you expect it in its entirety and not for other guests to receive preferential treatment.   Trying to sleep in the heat with no air-con was not exactly a comfortable experience.   Little things as well - such as, the tv didn’t connect to wifi so could not be used as a smart tv - so if the entertainment was rubbish (most nights) then you couldn’t even go back to the room to watch a film.  And - I don’t know what genius designed the bathroom but in our room the door stop was placed directly where you would step out of the shower.   Excursions at the hotel -  We booked to do quad biking, jet skis and dolphin spotting with the hotel.  They were good experiences- but just make sure you have travel insurance before partaking.   We were a little disappointed in the dolphin trip as we only saw one or two from a far distance but I think the staff that run the excursion could have taken some food for the dolphins to attract them to the boat. Instead they just drove around looking for one in the distance and then chase it. Overall was nice to see a dolphin but I’m sure a better experience could have been had.   In conclusion - we paid around £850 per person for a week here and I do not think it was worth it. I feel like we could have got better elsewhere for the money we spent and I do not think I would return."

        "review_text": "This is a lovely hotel. From the moment you enter the cavanus highly decorated and carved reception area you are so warmly welcomed by the staff. Everything about this hotel was so clean we were actually rather taken as we're very used to Egypt where hygiene is not, generally, so good. We had a Superior Double room but made an error on booking! We had booked a 'city view' by mistake which meant looking out over rooftops with a busy road right outside. This meant the noise of mopeds at all hours. Due to this we paid for an upgrade the following day to a sea view which we absolutely loved. Both rooms were immaculate and very spacious. Housekeeping was great and we loved the towel art. We generally tip every couple of days and we reap the rewards of above average service, which we feel is appropriate though we know some don't believe in doing this!   We booked 2x Al a carte while we were there (Italian and Tunisian) - the Italian was very bland unseasoned and no taste. No menus are offered so you don't know what each part of your fixed menu was and the food was just dumped on the table with no explanation of what was served. At the start I asked for a vodka and tonic and just received a stern reply of 'beer of wine'. I went to the bar to get my own drink. Such an awful experience we walked out past way through and cancelled the second booking. We spoke to other couples who had the same issues and also walked out!   Rim (lady server) on the main bar was very nice and always had a smile.   Abdala who served around the the pool was, again, always happy, smiling and he was always joking around with us and making our stay fun.   Worst white wine we've ever had in any hotel. We couldn't believe how bad the white wine was.   Sahara on reception was another team member worthy of note as she was very helpful.   Tea and coffee and water in room. There wasn't any unless you asked. Well, you got one bottle of water to stay but it wasn't replenished. You had to get your own water from the bar. Such a basic for a 5* hotel and really needs to be addressed.   Shower was very inconsistent and even getting an engineer in to fix it didn't work. Nothing worse than a shower that keeps going from hot to cold even after getting an engineer to our room.   No dressing table area with mirror and light in either room. Again, such a basic for a 5* hotel.   Animation team wear very drab colours and look like bar staff and waiters so it wasn't obvious who was who. They are really active but just don't stand out.   Real fresh juice in breakfast was a lovely bonus. And the general choices for all meals was very high and very fresh.   Love the music by the pool and in the bar. Classics sung in a totally new ballad way.   There is nothing outside this hotel other than a restaurant a few hundred yards away (which is awsome). All in all we found this to be a lovely hotel but definitely not a 5* experience"

        "review_text": "My review as a British Asian Muslim (Halal dietary requirements) family with a 3 year old toddler:  Room (Standard Double Room) Pros: •\tRoom is clean, spacious, very happy with it. •\tBed was firm but nice since I liked firm beds, I slept well. •\tSofa bed was nice (firm) •\tBalcony •\tTV is great and modern with all the apps you need •\tSmall drying rack - albeit it's good that there is one •\tPlug is 2 round pin euro style Cons: •\tA/C is too weak for the size of the rooms. Luckily it wasn't too hot when we went but if it was hotter I wouldn’t know what I'd do.  •\tThe beds are two mattresses which are joined together which are common in hotels, so they can come apart sometimes if you move around a lot. It didn't bother me, but some people find it annoying. You just have to make sure nobody is sleeping in the middle of the separation between mattresses, as when someone is on the separation then the beds come apart. •\tHousekeeping don’t replace water in rooms by default, had to call reception and ask.   Food & Drink Pros: •\tRestaurant food was great – tasty and the quality is high. •\tThe local Tunisian food options were interesting and nice. •\tThey served freshly grilled lamb chops on one of the days which were delicious •\tThe desserts are better than other all-inclusive restaurants I’ve stayed at – but the desserts are mostly the same every day. •\tOverall – the variety is somewhat a little lower than other places I’ve stayed, but it didn’t bother me as there is still a decent amount of variety and the food that they do have is of high quality and tasty. •\tThe non-alcoholic drinks at the bars are good •\tThey serve slush which is nice on a hot day! Cons: •\tNothing to eat outside of restaurant hours so didn’t feel fully all inclusive - I think this is due to the beach bar being closed and the snack bars in general not being open till late. When I called reception, they just said that I need to order room service. •\tNo tea and coffee at restaurant during lunch and dinner (only breakfast) •\tSome of the drinks are a little strong on syrup/sugar in particular the mocha. It’s funny because most all-inclusive places are too watered down, but this place did the opposite it seems! •\tEven though the food was nice, there wasn’t as much variety as we have seen in other all-inclusive resorts in other countries. My wife got a bit bored by the end (I was fine). It would be nice to have more variation over the week. Something like steak or burger night would be quite cool. Also, if the Tunisian dishes varied a little more during the week it would be nice. •\tBeach bar was closed until June which was a big negative for us since we like having the option of eating lunch by the sea instead of having to go to the restaurant   Beach & Pools Pros: •\tBeach is really nice in general, white sands and a nice breeze, very relaxing. The water is quite rough in May it seems, but that’s of no fault of the hotel obviously. But couldn’t go in with my child and swim etc. •\tNot a huge number of sunbeds but we didn’t struggle to find any since we went off season. Not sure how this would be in the busy season. •\tBeach Touters (please don’t judge them, and please be empathetic towards them!) are nowhere near as aggressive as other countries I’ve visited. They are respectful. I really enjoyed conversing with them and bought lots of stuff I didn’t need from them just to help them out to be honest. They were selling some cool scarves, so we bought those. I personally have a lot of respect for them even if they can come across a little pushy since they are usually poor and are doing their best to feed their families walking up and down a baking hot beach all day. •\tThere is a really nice heated indoor pool which we spent a lot of our time in. They keep the water really warm, and my child absolutely loved it. In May it wasn’t too busy, but I can imagine in busy months it could get busier. •\tWe didn’t try the outdoor pool as it was a little cool and we preferred the heated indoor pool, but it looked gorgeous, and a lot of people were really enjoying it. Cons: •\tCan be a little unkept in some parts with seaweed. In other 5-star hotels we've been to as they usually have someone cleaning up things like seaweed to neaten it up. •\tBeach touters: they [the beach touters] are 10 times less aggressive and more respectful than beach touters I’ve come across in other countries.    Amenities Pros: •\tLaundry is affordable •\tChildren's playroom was great, my daughter loved it •\tNot all signs have English, but that is Mahdia in general and not just the hotel Cons: •\tNo iron in the whole hotel •\tTowel deposits cost 50 dinars for each towel and since you can't take the money out of Tunisia it becomes tricky to do anything with it except give it away in tips (seems dishonestly convenient from their side... doesn’t look good). Since you’ll be returning the towels just before leaving the hotel and that doesn't give you time to do anything with it. •\tDeposits for a beach towel doesn't seem like a 5-star hotel sort of thing to do and doesn't really give a good impression to be honest but I understand that maybe these towels keep going “missing” and maybe that is why they have to enforce it. •\tBut if they must do it, they should allow you to do it in a different more convenient way such as paying with your own currency and not dinar or do it via bank funds so it can just be refunded or released back into your bank account. Otherwise, it just looks like a money grab for tips...   Staff & Service Pros: •\tHousekeeping to a great job at keeping the room and hotel very clean •\tCheck-in process itself was fine even though we didn’t really get an early check in and had to wait an hour for our room to be ready. •\tThe staff in general are professional and really friendly. •\tThe staff do mostly speak English, but there will be sometimes where you may need to get Google Translate out since they are more Arabic/French speakers which make sense since those are the languages spoken in the country. •\tThe hotel in general is very popular with French people. •\tIf you want to tip, I suggest 5 dinars per tip. I gave 10 most of the time as I didn’t have 5 dinars in change, but a 5-dinar tip is sufficient. •\tThe best thing about the staff is they don’t expect it or act funny if you don’t tip. And you feel as though it isn’t necessary to tip - which is how it should be. And they are super grateful if you do tip as it is a lot for them. They are nice and respectful to you regardless which is not the same for other countries I've visited in the same region of the world. Cons: •\tIf you arrive early before check-in you may have to wait a while like we did to get your room. We arrived at about 1.30pm and had to wait about an hour for our room to be ready. •\tOne guy at the reception was extremely rude. He called me over aggressively when he mistook me for a different guest, and when he realised it wasn’t the guest he was looking for, he didn’t apologise or anything. Wish I got his name, but I didn’t. I only ever saw him that once to be fair, thankfully. •\tBad Iberostar app - hasn't updated with the latest information such as the beach bar being closed. Functionality like chat with reception doesn’t work. •\tSigning in to the Iberostar App is a huge pain, you need to input all your details for every guest including things like passport number.   Cleanliness & Maintenance Pros: •\tThe hotel rooms and grounds are kept very clean and look impressive. Cons: •\tBeach could do with a little more maintenance with seaweed. •\tMaintenance staff were lazy and didn’t want to address our bath/sink blockage properly.   Toiletries & Bathroom Pros: •\tOur bathroom was very clean and nice to use overall. Had a bath with shower which some people don’t like – but it didn’t bother me. Cons: •\tOur bath and sink plug for some reason didn’t fit, and when it was inserted into the basins it ended up completely blocking the sink. So had to leave it them plugs completely removed which wasn’t very nice as you can see into the sink holes. I called maintenance and the guy basically just dismissed me and said to keep it off and there’s nothing wrong with it. He said that it’s ‘OK’ that the bath and sink get blocked. Not very 5-star at all. Very lazy behaviour from the maintenance team. •\tBody cream is heavily fragranced - not good for sensitive skin. Should use non-fragranced cream instead. •\tToilet paper is very thin.   Location Pros: •\tThe resort is very close to Mahdia’s old historical town. A 30 min walk or 5 min taxi (10 dinar we paid, but I didn’t haggle since it’s cheap as it is, but you might be able to go cheaper if you haggle more). The old town is gorgeous and quaint. Quiet. Relaxing to walk around and look at the beautiful buildings and beach. Pottery shops are so cool and beautiful, although I read on the internet that they may be finished with lead-based paint so probably shouldn’t use it for food, just decoration. But not sure if that’s true. There are a few beautiful things to see such as the Burj al-Kebir, the lighthouse, the archaeological museum, ancient sea gate of Mahdia, Great Fatimid Mosque, Shifa al-Kahla. In terms of the shopping, the vendors in general do inflate their prices, but in my experience it’s nowhere near as bad as other countries. And they are way less pushy. Just a much better environment in general and haggling is more fun than other countries I’ve been to since the vendors are more respectful (even if they are trying to rip you off a little) Cons: •\tCobblestone not great for travel prams •\tThe closest international airport is Enfidha which is a 1.5-2-hour drive away so it is a little far.  •\tThe surrounding area is a little run down, but it didn’t bother me.  •\tEven though the surrounding area is probably fine and the people are nice enough, I wouldn’t walk around the local areas with family etc. I only ever ventured out on my own when walking through the local areas. There are poor people around and sometimes they will follow you and ask for money etc which in itself doesn’t bother me myself, but I didn’t feel comfortable exposing my family to that.   Airport & Transfer Pros: •\tEnfidha airport on arrival was simple, quick. Good experience. Cons: •\tFor your inbound return flight, go a little earlier than you would normally (we went 2.5 hours early) since they inconveniently do not allow you to check in online. You must queue to check in manually at the airport, which took about 30 minutes for us. Factor this exra time into your travels. •\tOn inbound journey back to the UK, staff at Enfidha airport security are very rude, rushing you along etc. •\tAirport transfer takes 2 hours without toll, and 1.5 hours through the M’saken toll. If you book a private transfer, make sure you tell them you want to go through the toll since on the way to the hotel my driver ended up going the long way... don’t know why... maybe to save a few dinars. This really annoyed me since I paid good money for that transfer and they still cheaped out. So, make sure you specify that you want to go the quicker way. Recommended Local Taxi Driver: •\tMy taxi driver which was reliable and really nice:   Name: Fakri   Number: 0021626796965"

        "review_text": "Just back from a week long stay, here is my honest review.  From landing at Enfidha Airport we were around 3 hours to the hotel which was a long journey but we knew when we booked it that this would be the case which is a shame as Monastir Airport is relatively closer but there were no flights to there from Scotland.  We were greeted by the staff who took our bags up to our room for us, the rooms were lovely and we had a sea view which was outstanding. The maids changed our towels and beds everyday but went the extra mile with the lovely towel art. Can’t fault the rooms.  The pool was lovely and spacious and the service round the pool was amazing, before we had finished our drinks the bar staff would come over with fresh drinks all day long, possibly some of the best service I’ve ever had. The animation team done a great job keeping everyone entertained and a special mention to the water polo which was very competitive but lots of fun.  The food at lunch and dinner was nice, not exceptional but really good and lots on offer if you are a fussy eater.   The night time entertainment was a laugh and the animation team done a good job at the comedy nights by the getting the crowd up and involved. Once again as soon as You finished a drink they were over asking if you wanted more drinks.  Only a couple of negatives to take away from our trip:  The breakfast, it wasn’t to our taste which does not mean it is bad but it’s a lot more continental which included pastries, fresh fruit and vegetables. We lived on omelets and scrambled eggs all week😂.   The cocktails were sometimes non drinkable and tasted nothing like what they should have been. These are vodka and then they are put into a machine and the machine adds the mixers. We ordered strawberry daiquiris and pina coladas, these tasted nothing like what they should have but again this may be because they are poured out of a machine.  And last of all was the horse and carriage outside the hotel, I love animals and was saddened to see the horse stand outside in the heat with no constant water supply, I actually did not see the horse receive water once and I would regularly check. I just hope the horses are looked after.  These are the only downfalls to take away.   Apart from these it was a magnificent stay and I would 100% return as the service was excellent."

The restaurant and food were outstanding and you can also go to the Tunisian A’ la Carte which we absolutely loved.  The all inclusive drinks package covers enough different drinks to keep most folks happy, the bar staff turn to a couple of times a week and have cocktails poolside and in foyer.  The rooms are a decent size and the cleaning staff work hard to keep everything extremely clean and tidy.  They were replacing all the carpets on all floors while we were there it was not intrusive and they worked hard to cause minimal disruption."

        "review_text": "Been back home for about a week now haven't had the chance to do a review until now, never done a review before but I'll try my best for you if you're going here or thinking about it, me and my girlfriend went here for a week I'll try to give our overall experience not just the hotel.  The airport is probably the worst I've ever been too arriving was fine waited a while for cases but departure is even worse one shop to buy a drink and the queue was a mile long. easyJet was great for the transfer no issues there got us on the coach quick only downside was the driver begging us for a tip when we got to the hotel and I mean proper begging then storming off when we explained we had no cash yet. It's a closed currency so our plan was to find a cash machine when we got there which we did it's only around the corner from the hotel. The hotel is lovely and the receptionists are great we got checked in by Aymen and he was brilliant even gave us a discount for a trip we booked always smiling too. We had to wait a little bit for the room to be ready we had a first floor room with a garden view, the garden and flowers are lovely but privacy wasn't great gardeners were often outside working away so we had to keep the curtains closed a lot of the time sometimes a cleaner would randomly appear at the doors too picking all the flowers which im guessing they're using for decorating the bed for people that tip them. The best thing about the hotel is the staff they're all brilliant and lovely especially the waiters they work very hard. The food is nice at first but it gets a bit boring and you notice that some of yesterday's dinner has become the next days lunch but that's cheap all inclusive I suppose, I also came back home slightly unwell but I was fine for the time I was there just the last day and journey home I didn't feel too great. The outside restaurant by the pool is very nice if you're just sunbathing and don't want to rush in for lunch, it's open for a while so can go over whenever you fancy but I noticed the sauces had quite a few dead bugs in them so avoid them. Tunisian night in the main restaurant was brilliant probably when I ate the most, breakfast is very nice too kind of the same stuff every day but the Tunisian doughnuts are amazing you just have to be quick because they're very popular especially with the kids. Desserts are brilliant too always some nice cakes and pastries, drinks are good too proper stuff in glass bottles. Outside the hotel was pretty much hell for us when you leave and turn right to go to a cash machine or the sunflower shop there's guys with horses and carriages that pester you so you have to get past them, we had two people walk up to us claiming to work in the hotel and when I laughed and said no you don't they ran off which is a bit strange. The shop people don't leave you alone they do anything to draw you into a conversation touching my tattoos or asking about my trainers (don't wear nice expensive shoes just wear sliders I learnt the hard way), I did actually need some little bit so I went into a couple of shops and one guy was just trying to rip me off constantly so make sure you know the exchange rates, they offer things for free aswell just to try rope you into buying more stuff he was walking around just filling up carrier bags with stuff and didn't stop even when I said I'm not interested and don't want any of it. In another shop the guy gave us a big sob story about how it's low season and they're really struggling which I understand but his shop is tiny and didn't have much so we left and for the rest of our trip he would stand on the corner whenever he seen us and would stare at us I'm a big guy too so not sure why he was trying to be intimidating 😂, if you're going to go to any shops stick to the sunflower you'll see it it's blue and got massive signs its just a bit tricky to get there as you have to get past all the pestering shops and the quick way to it is blocked off for some strange reason guessing the locals have done it so you've got no choice but to go past the pesterers but the sunflower has everything the same stuff as the other shops and snacks drinks sweets etc and it's all fixed price no pestering just get your stuff and go the till. We booked a couple of trips whilst we were there one was with a guy who walks around in the morning calling himself \"the captain\" because apparently he's the captain of his boats which turned out to be not true he's just the salesman, he gave us two options action or relax we wanted a chill holiday so chose relax he said nice catamaran trip no less the 5 people with drinks and lunch included and guess what? It wasn't relaxing there was about 25 of us on the catamaran and most were french teenagers going absolutely crazy im surprised none of them ended up overboard, the sea was not calm we was getting bounced around for ages and a few people felt sick. Drinks included Fanta coke and sprite which came in a little plastic cup every hour. Lunch was a slice of melon. Once we had stopped and people had a swim the way back was a lot calmer and enjoyable we even seen a dolphin. Theres another guy that sells quad bike and camel ride trips but we weren't interested in that.  We also booked a trip to sidi bou said, Carthage and Tunis Medina through the hotel, we had a private driver that took us to all places and took us back to the hotel. Carthage was absolutely brilliant seeing the old Roman ruins and they had actual mosaics still intact it was great would recommend it if that's you're kind of thing. Tunis Medina was absolute hell I had people following me for ages trying to sell me sunglasses trying to put them on me and not taking no for an answer, everything in the Medina is the same stuff you can buy in most shops so nothing special, I didn't feel safe there one bit. Sidi bou said is beautiful but it's very busy and the pestering is also non stop we climbed to the top I was sweating and short of breath and I had 5 guys trying to put falcons on me I nearly started throwing punches they would take no for an answer. Our driver was lovely but for most of the driving he kept talking about his Spanish friend that lives in sidi bou said and how hilarious he is he's a painter and we should learn some Spanish bla bla bla and guess what? We get to sidi bou said and taken to the Spanish friend and amazingly he owns a shop 😂 so they all stood there watching us walk around the shop I felt like a hostage and had to buy something but luckily my girlfriend needed an ashtray so she bought one and they even tried selling us more stuff. Those were the only trips we did and I'd only recommend Carthage. The entertainment team in the hotel were all nice and funny besides one who I won't name we had been out on a trip all day got back knackered and just wanted to chill by the pool he came over asking us to do archery or something I explained we've been out all day we're tired and for the rest of my time there I'd get snidey remarks about how tired I am. The beach is very nice and the lifeguards are great they look after you I didn't go in the sea though my girlfriend did and she said it was a bit dirty but we preferred to be by the pool anyway the pool is brilliant but a bit cold. Overall we had a decent time we chose this place because of the reviews and it's nice but I don't understand all the amazing reviews it's not that great in my opinion, if you're looking for a cheap all inclusive holiday I'd definitely recommend this place it's nice but it's not mind blowing like a lot of the reviews say, if I was on a budget I'd go back but I'm not rushing back I think another country for me next. This was my 2nd time in Tunisia the first time I went to Djerba and I enjoyed Djerba a lot more than hammamet, Tunisia is a beautiful country and most of the people are very nice there's definitely a lot of potential for the country to be amazing but the pestering is just insane if you leave people alone you're more likely to have more people wandering around your shop, I feel like the niceness is just fake to get you to buy something but the normal people that don't work in shops etc are lovely they always say welcome to Tunisia I hope you're having a nice time but some people warn you about scammers and then try to scam you like our private driver. But hopefully I've given a good review, if you're looking for a cheap all inclusive holiday with nice weather and you just wanna chill by the pool or on the beach definitely go here you can't go wrong but the second you leave the hotel be prepared but it's not nice. Also want to mention 90% of the guests in the hotel are french I found a lot of them quite rude and a lot of them smoke constantly so I did get a bit annoyed by the pool when I'm trying to chill and all I could hear is french and the smell of smoke but most probably wouldn't care it just got a bit annoying for me, the other 10% are British/Dutch/polish and polish people from the UK they were great we had a laugh with them, we spoke to some Spanish and Portuguese people too but vast majority are french"

        "review_text": "- [ ] There was no iron in the room so we had to ask for it. And we had it for the duration of our trip.  - [ ] No water unless all inclusive despite being 4 starts.  - [ ] Food alright same all the time. They did have chips and nuggets at one point which did save me.  - [ ] Decent location with shops and bazar close by. Also 20 min walk and you’re near the Maxi center where there are more food places and shops.  - [ ] We experienced our first carnival  - [ ] Booked excursion and tourist stuff through hotel as it was more reliable.  - [ ] The hotels spa rooms were being refurbed so we were able to go to another hotel and use their facilities. There is a guy there who works at iberostar and takes people to the spa place (2 min drive)  - [ ] Customer service went above and beyond 10/10. We booked 2 sea view rooms which we did and had a door connecting the rooms. We weren’t happy with the bathroom or the bedding. They kindly moved us to the opposite room for the night and said they’ll sort it in the morning. They kindly gave us water when we spoke to them about the room and there not being any water. In the morning they said they’re doing everything they can, made sure whatever room we got it had a sea view and they made sure of it. They let us check out the rooms before they moved us to make sure we were happy and we were. Again the bathroom wasn’t the greatest but it was bearable - [ ] For a 4 star hotel I expected more. Interior a little outdated.  - [ ] Wish the pool hours were a little longer so after a long day of being out we could’ve spent time in the pool. Maybe because of the season it’s 9am-6pm.  - [ ] No air con doesn’t come on until June…let’s just say sometimes it did get a little warm but nothing too bad.  -[ ] 24/7 security outside the hotel and its gates and they do security checks on each and every vehicle.  - [ ] Overall the stay, hospitality and people there were amazing."

        "review_text": "Traveled as friends we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights as a little getaway and it was brilliant. The service from staff at this hotel was amazing the hotel itself is lovely there’s a big pool with a swim up bar which the drinks were good, very good from the barman Mtir. The food in the dining hall was nice I would say it’s abit repetitive but there was every meat you could want and more, the food stations don’t always have signs on to tell you what dish it is maybe that could be improved but still delicious as was dessert and fruit options. The entertainment team were fantastic always making sure you’re happy around the pool asking you to get involved with activities and teaching you dances etc. Big shout out to Yuma & Alpha they were brilliant. Evening entertainment was okay could’ve been abit more on and didn’t finish too early. The rooms are spacious with 2 wardrobes comes with a fridge and separate toilet to the bathroom, beds were comfy however pillows were abit hard.. the corridors to the rooms were a abit outdated and could do with a little touch up but nothing big. Our time at this hotel was lovely and I would recommend it if you’re looking for a quiet place to stay! Right on a sandy beach. Thanks to all the lovely staff / entertainment staff."

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Iberostar Waves Averroes from May 8 to 12 with my mother, aunt and cousin to celebrate my mom’s birthday. This trip had great sentimental value for us, as we came to discover our grandmother’s homeland. And this hotel has made our stay even more special.  Upon arrival, we were greeted with warmth and kindness. The staff was simply adorable, always attentive, attentive and available at all times. So much so that they have come to call us “the family”, which perfectly sums up the friendly and caring atmosphere that prevails in the hotel.  The setting is idyllic: a large swimming pool, beautiful gardens perfectly maintained, a private beach with direct access... A real little corner of paradise. The cleaning team also touched us with its delicate attention: folded towels in adorable shapes, small flowers on the bed... simple gestures that were always pleasure 🌸  The most beautiful memory is undoubtedly our meeting with the animation team. Thanks from the bottom of my heart to Faty, Djappa, Alpha and the whole team for their good humor, humor and communicative energy. Thanks to them, we participated in lots of activities, laughed and created memories engraved forever. You can see that they really love what they do, and it’s a real joy to see them convey so much joy.  The icing on the cake, we also met great people during our stay, with whom we immediately sympathized. Many shared laughs, simple but sincere moments that made our experience even more beautiful.  As for the restaurant, the buffet was well supplied and varied: international dishes, fresh fruit at will, and a small stand of local specialities. A big thank you to the catering team, always available and attentive. The only downside would be the lack of typical Tunisian dishes throughout the buffet, and a little disappointment regarding the restaurant “L’Olivier”.  But overall, Miss France leaves with stars full of eyes 👑✨ A huge thank you to the entire Iberostar Waves Averroes team for these precious moments. We leave with a light heart, a calm mind and with memories full of head 💛"

        "review_title": "RAW CHICKEN… TWICE.",
        "review_text": "So to begin with the entire food station was cross contaminated. Not enough utensils to pick food up at the food station leaving people to use one utensil to mix in various foods. Best of luck if you have any food allergies as you are screwed from day one.  To mention not a single person asked if we had any allergies or intolerances which I do.  Over 60% of the food station have no food labels so much of the food was unidentified.   which leads me nicely to the “ox tail and peppers.” This dastardly dish was a mix of beef and liver which had no mention on the food label of liver and caused my partner to be sick in the toilets that night as she has intolerances to offal. A daring deceitful tactic to fool the public to robust a dish by adding liver. When I mentioned this to the manager his first reaction was to laugh and think it was funny.  On multiple occasions there were subtleties of sexism by the bar staff in particular the shisha man where he found it appropriate to mock my partner and pull a face. A barman found it okay to insist we gave him a 5 star rating and then had the audacity to address me as “good boy,” how offensive. This was all mentioned to the hotel manager the following night along with all my food concerns.  Despite all of this  I was still served RAW chicken from the cook station. Pink, cold and bloody. What an absolute disgrace. Despite having a meeting with the Hotel Manager and the Sous Chef about this the very next night I was yet AGAIN served RAW CHICKEN!!!! I have no words left for my experience that we booked an early flight and cancelled the rest of our holiday 3 days early and now are seeking formal resolve with Easyjet for one of the worst experiences I can recall in 20 years.  On to the gym, those who are interested. There was no air conditioning, no tissues to wipe equipment or a water station to use. So it was absolutely baking in there not to mention the constant smell of dust from the building work just next door.   Cocktails as you can imagine were pretty basic. Don’t expect anything other than mixing drinks together.   One other thing to mention is the dated saxophone lift music played on repeat throughout the day. Goodness gracious it gets annoying.   So to mention a few positives as promised. The tennis court was good. Rackets and balls supplied. Some of the evening entertainment was good.  The weather held up nicely for May. The fruit station was good and the chocolate fountain was nice.   To conclude this establishment is a disgrace to Tunisia and cannot fairly represent Tunisian food or culture. I would not set foot in this dump ever again even if you paid me nor would I ever return to this country when I have Italy across the sea.  My verdict AVOID AVOID, Heavens AVOID."

        "review_text": "My husband and I stayed for one week at the end of April early May. The hotel was well maintained and clean throughout, with security on the gate making it feel a safe place to relax.   The reception staff were welcoming and helpful answering any questions we had regarding taxi prices and destination advice.  The entertainment team were really friendly, encouraging everyone to participate in the activities.  We played petanque on the beach, darts around the pool and Yoga every morning. Bingo, Tunisia night and cocktail evenings where just a few of the evening entertainment activities.   The Laurier buffet restaurant was spacious and offered a wide selection of foods. We also used the La Palmier the beach buffet area most lunch times. Waiters at both were very welcoming, attentive and polite.  Abdul was our main waiter in the Fleurs Dr Lys lounge bar. He was great, surprising us with delicious cocktails every evening.  Amhed was our main pool bar waiter, again fabulous service remembering our drinks orders and ensuring we had plenty of bottled water for our room.    Our housekeeper, unfortunately we didn't catch her name, was great. Always making sure we had clean towels etc and surprising us with fabulous towel origami each day.   Tunisia it's self is a beautiful place with white sandy beaches and a clear blue sea. However, it is a very poor part of the world and you can see this in the upkeep of some of the buildings and empty hotels"

        "review_text": "Had a really good time. Would recommend. A few issues, but for the price, manageable. Firstly: food was amazing, loved it. Fresh fish daily. I had planned to cycle everywhere, but due to Ramadan, the local bike shops were closed. The hotel sorted a hire car for the next day ( cheaper than up the road). The reception staff were very efficient. I booked a quad biking excursion at the Hotel ( cheaper than prebooking in the uk), great fun. I enjoyed the Arabic lessons at the hotel and the pottery demonstration. Darts & archery - not for me. It rained 4/7 days. The topography was so green on the flight in. I booked this hotel for the spa, but this was closed for refurbishment and I liked the idea of kayaking & using the pedalo, but being March, it was too windy and still \"winter\" season. I booked using love holidays, which was the cheapest & booked the Carthage excursion with them, it was amazing. Went to Hammamet, a bit of hassle to buy stuff( kasbar), didn't stay long. Walked to  Pupput Roman site, ok, only £1.20. Overgrown at the time. Visited Dar Sebastian villa and Gardens ( where Rommel stayed, then Montgomery and Churchill wrote his memoirs). I drove to Enfidaville to find my Grandfather in the CWGC. A bit of hassle there, but worth it. I really liked the Isle of fish by the Yasmin Hammamet marina. ( boats, bikes, fishing gear available in the summer). Finally, if you've read this far : I arrived on the beach on day 1 : despite strong winds and few people, I was approached by camel man, then jewelry man, as I walked along the beach, I was aware of a vehicle following me...yes one jumped out and told me to go to the bizarre with him. In 2km I was hassled 6 times ( I'm 6 foot 3 !). I guess they are desperate for sales. A regular chat up is \" I work at your hotel & I'm out of uniform\" so be warned, their dental work should give them away ! I now fully understand why people stay at the hotel. In summary the staff & hotel were great. Have your wits about you when venturing out."

        "review_text": "We stayed a week in all inclusive at this hotel in early April. The hotel is well located, with direct access to the beach, and not far from the Medina. Nothing to say about the reception and service, all the staff, whether at the reception, restaurant or activities, is helpful and inviting. It wasn't the full season yet so the hotel was quiet, I guess there must be more people later in the season. On the other hand, the pool bar was not open yet, and the entertainment a little light, no or few people attended, so it was always a bit the same every night despite the efforts of the whole animation team who were passing really nice and with whom we had very good times. At the restaurant level, the buffet for all meals is complete, varied and really good, we ate very (too) well all week. The drinks offered as part of the package are enough, we did not have to add to get what we wanted. The rooms are rather spacious for 2, maybe a little more just for 3 (we were 5 and we had 2 connecting rooms of identical size, one for 2 and one for 3), on the other hand the shower was large and well designed, it is rare to be able to take a shower in a hotel without having to water the whole bathroom. A small downside, however, on the maintenance, we could see that several elements were patched together, such as the toilet-paper support, like the somewhat capricious flush, or like the bathroom door that did not close because she had worked. We had a great week and would recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "We do not have a single bad thing to say about this hotel.   When we arrived the gardens were filled with a flurry of butterflies which made it all feel very magical. The gardens and flowers are stunning and the flowers beautiful, a credit to all of the hardworking gardeners and groundsmen.   The staff were at the door ready to meet us and we were checked in quickly. We paid approximately £50 in tourist tax and for the safe for the 7 day stay.   The bar staff are so attentive. We would like to give an extra special mention to Hamza. From the moment we arrived and sat down at the outside terrace he did everything he could, over and above, to make us feel special and welcome. I will miss his “special” iced coffees. He is an absolute ray of sunshine and always has a smile on his face. We would have taken him home with us if we could! All of the bar staff were amazing especially Abderrahmet, who put the football on the big screen for my husband (and made him a very happy man!). I don’t think there was a single cocktail I didn’t enjoy and my husband was more than happy with the local beer.   Ben the Lifeguard Manager is an absolute superstar as well, thank you for getting us the perfect spot in the sunshine. Thank you to Ahmed for looking after us, checking we were okay and for constantly bringing us drinks, beautifully decorated with flowers and lemon slice hearts. He is a diamond and yet another member of staff who made us feel so welcome and special.   It’s been a pleasure meeting you all. You all made us feel so welcome and like family. For this reason we have already booked to come back next year!   The hotel is immaculate. Staff are constantly cleaning, tidying, and sprucing up the place. Our room was cleaned daily and the cleaning staff are so lovely.   The food was also amazing, there was always a varied choice. A big shout out to all of the chefs and kitchen staff who are so talented. The puddings always looked like works of art, too beautiful to eat! Kamal our waiter in the main restaurant was always ready and waiting to greet us with a big smile, an “alright” and a hi-five. All of the staff are dressed impeccably and so well mannered and polite. They always have a smile on their face and say hello and wave when they see you.   We enjoyed breakfast and lunch most days at the BBQ at the outside restaurant. Sofienna always had our table ready for us and decorated with beautiful flowers. He brought us bread rolls and butter for every meal and treated us like royalty! He is an absolute credit to the hotel. We will really miss him! Jabeur is also a little sweetheart, he has the cutest smile and cannot do enough for you! Both Sofienna and Jabeur worked at the Al a carte restaurant, which was traditional Tunisian cuisine. The food was delicious and we felt like we were dining in a 5 star restaurant. As always we felt like the staff could not do enough for us.   The WiFi was fantastic, we had no issues at all during our stay. The beach was clean and tidy and the sea was just beautiful. It was so relaxing just to sit and listen to the waves crashing whilst enjoying a cocktail.   The animation team were all lovely, and didn’t pressure you into getting involved in the activities. My husband played beach bowls, archery and darts and really enjoyed himself. Alpha was especially friendly and polite. Like everyone else he always had a smile on his face and entertained us with his dance moves.   We booked a trip on a pirate ship through the hotel rep which was great fun and we would highly recommend doing this!   There are a couple of shops outside the hotel, we got some lovely gifts from the Sunflower and some home comforts like coke and red bull (all at reasonable prices).   I am one of those people who get bitten every-time we go away and I didn’t get bitten once. I only saw about three mosquitoes to be absolutely honest.   As a side note the airport, although small, was a doddle. From landing to getting to our transfer took about half an hour!   This was an amazing holiday. Perfect for couples who just want to sunbathe and relax. We cannot recommend this hotel or its staff more highly. Thank you for an unforgettable holiday! We can’t wait to see you all again next year!"

At lunch as at dinner there was a lot of variety but it was really guessing that you ate because there were either no signs or they were not in their correct order. Then if you want to eat something between lunch and dinner, basically make do with what's left of lunch. Regarding the cleanliness leaves enough to be desired, at one time we arrived in the afternoon and had not yet cleaned the room. The hotel lacks much maintenance and better ventilation especially on the first floor where the restaurant windows are... Oh, and the heated pool is just the mbiebte, not the water.  Read more"

        "review_text": "We’ve stayed in resorts across Mexico, Cape Verde, India, Asia, Greece and Turkey but this was one of our best holidays for overall value, food, and service.  The food was excellent most days, with generous seafood options the prawns in particular were a highlight. We never struggled to find something delicious, and appreciated the variety on offer.  We were also really impressed by how welcoming the staff were towards our autistic teenager. He felt genuinely included, joined in with the evening shows, and even participated on a few occasions , something that doesn’t happen often. That made a huge difference to us as a family, and we’re really grateful.  Our suite was surprisingly spacious , much larger than we expected. We actually spent more time in the room than we typically would on holiday, simply because it was so comfortable and relaxing.  We’ve already decided to return in October!  If we had one small suggestion, it would be for the gym , it would be helpful to have water and cups available early in the morning. There were a couple of days where the water dispenser hadn’t been topped up. But that’s a very minor point in what was otherwise a fantastic experience.  Highly recommended and a special thank you to the staff for making us feel so at home."

        "review_text": "Just returned from a wonderful week at this hotel with all the family.  We have nothing to complain about, we were so well looked after by the staff across all areas of the hotel. From the maid in our room to the waiters in the restaurant, pool and main bar and the animation team. Nothing was too much trouble and they were all so friendly and great with the grandchildren.  It’s a larger hotel than we are used to but there was always sunbeds round the pool and  beach and somewhere to sit in the evening. As we were a party of nine a table was saved for us in the dining room by our lovely waiter Khaled everyday.  Food was lovely, great selection every night, so plenty to choose from and something for everybody. First visit to this hotel but 8th to Tunisia, we will return again"

Sea water pool was amazing but not enough sit for everyone.  All the staff in the hotel were very nice and friendly. I will recommend this hotel for relaxing coz it bit far from the madina or souk."

        "review_text": "This was my first ever experience of staying in an all inclusive, beach front resort and I must say that Iberostar Selection Kantaoui Bay has set a high standard that I think a lot of other hotels cannot reach. I stayed with my husband and 2 young children for 9 days.  When you first step in to the building, you will immediately know that you're in good hands. The security staff and reception staff are very warm and professional. RAHMA was very efficient at dealing with our enquiries and clearly takes pride in doing her job to the best if her ability. My son had an accident and RAHMA was great in swiftly dealing with the issue. The security guard on shift at the time (he is tall with glasses) kindly came over to reassure my son, which was a lovely touch and reflects the family orientated mentality of the Tunisian people, which I love.  Moreover, the staff are what make this hotel great: there is no slacking here and everyone is putting 100% into what they do. I am fussy about cleanliness and my housekeeper,  NADA was fantastic. She is very warm and friendly and did a spectacular job at keeping our family room clean everyday. It's the first hotel I've stayed in where the cleaning looks as good everyday as the first day you step in to your room.  I had a family room facing the entrance. If you really value peace at night, I don't recommend this side of the building as there was a lot of noise at night with people coming and going, barking guard dogs and lively birds (I actually enjoyed the birdsong, but it may not be for everyone). I had to leave my windows open because of the lack of AC (mentioned later).  My only issue with cleanliness and maintenance would be the gym area, which is currently looking rather neglected which a lot of equipment not working and not a great selection of lower end weights. It also doesn't appear to be as clean as the rest of the hotel. However,  I raised my concerns with the hotel manager (regrettably, I didn't get his name) and he is aware of this and explained that this area is in a process of change. The manager, who is undoubtedly very busy running such a big resort, was always very pleasant, approachable and willing to listen.  I also didn't like that AC is not available in Tunisian hotels from the winter until June due to a government mandate. Again, the manager offered a different room that would be in a cooler part of the building, so he was understanding.   Having a very sensitive digestive system, I was apprehensive about the hotel food. The food is varied daily, there is something for all tastes and it is overall very healthy, with the majority of dishes being grilled and plenty of fruit and veg options are available. I am a real foodie and felt spoilt for choice everyday. I would like to add though that if the selection could include a wider range of flavours (e.g. spiced food not just from the Tunisian section), it would create an even better variety.  The restaurant manager does an excellent job keeping the space pleasant and orderly. The waiters and waitresses are very attentive. JALAL, OUMAYMA, DHAWI and many others are great at their job, but to be honest in the restaurant,  I couldn't fault any of the staff and their work ethic.   My children regularly stayed in the kids club and the talented MAYA did an excellent job keeping them entertained.   For the price we paid, I didn't expect true 5* quality but we certainly received it. There were people of all backgrounds staying in the hotel and I highly recommend it. If you're going with a family, it's perfect,  but if you're in a couple only or just looking for a fun few days with friends it's great too.  The location is OK. We walked along the beach to the port and it took us 50 minutes (we walked with children, so would be quicker if you're young and fit with no kids!). There are some shops selling souvenirs, a pharmacy, money exchange and a few eateries within walking distance. There are, however, a number of excursions available and dedicated staff who can help to advise you and book this for you.  Finally, we got the best exchange rate at the bank at the port (banks offer the best exchange (post office in Tunisia is ok, too. We were told it's the same rate everywhere, but that's not true!).  I really recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed!"

Our cleaner Sonia always put a smile on our face and looked after us well.   Nothing was too much for her or Marva. The room was cleaned everyday to perfection. Drinks were always topped up by Ali without fail. I enjoyed seeing them everyday, they would always stop for a chat no matter how busy they were.   The staff at the dining hall were just as good. Nothing was too much. Always served with a smile. The waiters were amazing..we had a toddler with us so as soon as they would see us enter they would get a high chair ready at the table for us. To name a few Khalid and illyas became our regular waiters. They would honour of their way to entertain the toddler (who could sometimes be hard work)  The bar also went the extra mile. We don't drink alcohol they were happy to make alternative drinks. Meeda Meena in particular became very familiar and would soon have non alcoholic drinks ready for us when we went to the bar.  The entertainment team always tried to get everyone involved. They had different entertainment every night to cater for different needs.   Overall from reception staff to each and every staff there I cannot fault the customer service and would definitely return."

        "review_text": "The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I had booked a standard room, but since we were celebrating a special occasion, I emailed the hotel in advance and asked if it would be possible to get a sea view. They kindly upgraded our room for free, which I really appreciated.  We were a family of three , my husband, our 8-year-old daughter, and I. The beach had beautiful white sand and was perfect for relaxing. There was also a marina about a 30-minute walk away along the beach, which made for a nice outing.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served buffet-style. In addition to the buffet, the hotel had two à la carte restaurants — Italian and Tunisian  which required advance booking. Unfortunately, our experience at the Italian restaurant was very disappointing. Despite the restaurant not being particularly busy, there was nearly a one-hour wait between the starter and the main course. We had ordered our steak well-done, but it arrived medium after all that time. While the staff did apologize and replaced it, the delay made it very difficult — especially with a young child.  Other aspects of the hotel also fell short of expectations. The bathtubs in the rooms had been removed and replaced with standing showers, and we were only informed of this a day before our trip. The service overall didn’t feel like five-star quality. While the food offered a lot of variety, it was quite average in taste. Towels were changed daily, but they were old and worn out.  There was a hair salon in the hotel that I definitely do not recommend. I had my hair braided, as I often do on holidays, but the braids started coming undone after just two days. They charged £50, which was expensive, and the next day told me they had undercharged me and asked for more money very unprofessional.  There were entertainment programs every night, but they were very basic and not particularly engaging. The alcoholic drinks were poorly made and low quality.  So, would I return to this hotel? Honestly, no. While there were a few positive aspects, overall it did not meet the standards of a true five-star experience."

        "review_text": "I’ll start by saying the hotel is not perfect, it’s certainly not 5 star and is in need of some refurb.   That aside we thoroughly enjoy our stay and there’s a lot on offer for families, this is our 2nd stay and we would come back again.  All staff are amazing, it’s a shame we can’t name everyone individually, but special shout to animation team : Yaya and Maya for the kids club / activities and Mira,Lou Lou, Speedy, Cristiano and not forgetting the DJ Steve all deserve 5 stars they make the stay fun and you can’t help but attached to them, it’s sad to say bye but we’ll be back.  As mentioned the room’s need some refurb, cracked tiles etc, but that can be a good overlooked as the cleaning staff keep the rooms very clean and tidy, “Sonia” was our cleaner and greeted us with her wonderful smile daily and the service from her and her team was 5 stars.  Thanks to all the staff bar staff and waiters can’t name you all we felt truly well looked after.  Tesh, Hena & Ethan"

        "review_text": "What an absolutely fabulous hotel and stay. We would highly recommend it and hope to return.   What we enjoyed:   EVERYTHING!   FOOD: was delicious, huge variety for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was decent, and still enjoyable. The best cappuccino I’ve had anywhere (I’m not a coffee drinker). They had several fresh cooking stations, which was a pleasant touch. Lots of space and stations. Something for everyone. They had two other restaurants onsite, a Tunisian and Italian one, which we didn't try, because we really enjoyed the buffets!   ROOM: beautiful, spacious and clean room. Our housekeeping lady Radhia (room 476) was lovely. Always made our room look fresh, with fresh linen and flowers every day. Very comfortable bed and plush pillows.   POOL: was FREEZING lol but that’s to be expected with it being sea water. Go in HOT weather to be able to enjoy the pool. We got good temperature for most our stay. Majid who works poolside serving drinks at sunbeds, was absolutely awesome. Great service with a smile for everyone regardless of background. A very pleasant human.   ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment team were absolutely fabulous! I absolutely rate their energy considering they run fun activities throughout the day, change, and then run evening entertainment. We really enjoyed the games throughout the day which brought people together from all over for some light-hearted fun and competition. We played darts and French ball. A lot more fun than they sounds! They had so much more. Ask for the entertainment timetable upon check in so you don't miss out on anything you'd fancy.    HOTEL: was beautiful. Clean, comfortable, friendly staff, welcoming and helpful. Private beach access, which was very clean with plenty of beds, and food service nearby, if you don’t want to trek it back to the restaurant inside.   This was our first trip to Tunisia. It’s a very serene, calm and peaceful place from our experience. There’s not lots to do, so you can really kick back and relax in an all inclusive and not feel FOMO. If you do want to explore a little, we would recommend Port El Kantoui, which is a pretty Port area, very close to the hotel. You can go for a stroll along the parade of shops, or take a boat ride. Also would recommend Sousse Grand Mosque and Sousse Medina. A lovely place to visit, and you can pick up a traditional dress at a good price - a traditional LINEN knee length dress is 25 Dinar. Ignore the invites to go into the shops, and you'll save yourself some hassle.   TAXI PRICE GUIDE FROM HOTEL: a 5 minute taxi journey should cost no more than 7 – 10 Dinar. To the Medina, taxi is 20 Dinar. From the airport we paid £25 (UK pound). We got the number of our driver off here. Came recommended. His name is Lassaad. A very respectful and decent honest man. We would highly recommend him too. His contact number is +216 54 463 377. If he is not available, he will send his brother, but sets the price himself so you will not get ripped off.   HOTEL IMPROVEMENTS:  \tTemperature of the food could have been better. Sometimes it was even cold like the donner kebab and roast chicken that were at the live stations  \tTwo of the lifeguards we very unnecessarily rude to us. Once when we asked for mattresses and moments later, we got a very huffy puffy lifeguard when we asked for an umbrella. Note, they provide these services to everyone, but chose to be rude to us for no reason at all, which was very upsetting  \tThere is a clear difference between staff hospitality for the white folk over everyone else, to the point of being obvious. We don’t care for all the excessiveness they do with White folk, if we get our service. But at dinner, you will notice the stark difference. Several times, we had to flag someone down for fizzy drinks, while watching excessive table service for White folk. Not very pleasant to watch  \tTip culture. You almost feel forced to give tips for bits of information you didn’t ask for. As a couple, we actually are generous tippers, but it’s not nice to see people loitering, or holding you back to give you information you didn’t ask for, and then standing there hoping for a tip. Made us uncomfortable on many occasions. Happened across the hotel. We quickly learned to ignore it \tThe hotel is very quality driven. If you give anything less than 5* on any question in the survey at dinner (they bring the tablet to you), expect the staff to get a grilling, which I thought was a bit harsh  \tWater sports team were horrible in their attitude, approach and quite mean, rude and hostile once you’ve purchased an activity. Very cold poker faced approach, which made us uncomfortable considering the had to ensure our safety for the paragliding we did!   We stayed for 5 nights and aside of two bottles of drink upon arrival, and water daily, our mini bar was not filled once.   They put two single beds and mattresses together to make a double. Not ideal if you're travelling as a couple  Hope they take the improvements on board, because it really is an awesome hotel. We loved it otherwise, and hope to return InshaAllah (“.)"

        "review_text": "This hotel location is very good for beach holiday and relaxing. Their welcoming was not that great, as no one came to us to show the hotel and introduce us every thing, we had to find and look for all the facilities. Other than that the room was very clean, the lady Farida was very nice and hardworking. She is very helpful and friendly.  Food was very good and organised. Waiters were friendly and polite. Sea water pool was amazing but not enough sit for everyone.  All the staff in the hotel were very nice and friendly. I will recommend this hotel for relaxing coz it bit far from the madina or souk."

        "review_text": "This was my first ever experience of staying in an all inclusive, beach front resort and I must say that Iberostar Selection Kantaoui Bay has set a high standard that I think a lot of other hotels cannot reach. I stayed with my husband and 2 young children for 9 days.  When you first step in to the building, you will immediately know that you're in good hands. The security staff and reception staff are very warm and professional. RAHMA was very efficient at dealing with our enquiries and clearly takes pride in doing her job to the best if her ability. My son had an accident and RAHMA was great in swiftly dealing with the issue. The security guard on shift at the time (he is tall with glasses) kindly came over to reassure my son, which was a lovely touch and reflects the family orientated mentality of the Tunisian people, which I love.  Moreover, the staff are what make this hotel great: there is no slacking here and everyone is putting 100% into what they do. I am fussy about cleanliness and my housekeeper,  NADA was fantastic. She is very warm and friendly and did a spectacular job at keeping our family room clean everyday. It's the first hotel I've stayed in where the cleaning looks as good everyday as the first day you step in to your room.  I had a family room facing the entrance. If you really value peace at night, I don't recommend this side of the building as there was a lot of noise at night with people coming and going, barking guard dogs and lively birds (I actually enjoyed the birdsong, but it may not be for everyone). I had to leave my windows open because of the lack of AC (mentioned later).  My only issue with cleanliness and maintenance would be the gym area, which is currently looking rather neglected which a lot of equipment not working and not a great selection of lower end weights. It also doesn't appear to be as clean as the rest of the hotel. However,  I raised my concerns with the hotel manager (regrettably, I didn't get his name) and he is aware of this and explained that this area is in a process of change. The manager, who is undoubtedly very busy running such a big resort, was always very pleasant, approachable and willing to listen.  I also didn't like that AC is not available in Tunisian hotels from the winter until June due to a government mandate. Again, the manager offered a different room that would be in a cooler part of the building, so he was understanding.   Having a very sensitive digestive system, I was apprehensive about the hotel food. The food is varied daily, there is something for all tastes and it is overall very healthy, with the majority of dishes being grilled and plenty of fruit and veg options are available. I am a real foodie and felt spoilt for choice everyday. I would like to add though that if the selection could include a wider range of flavours (e.g. spiced food not just from the Tunisian section), it would create an even better variety.  The restaurant manager does an excellent job keeping the space pleasant and orderly. The waiters and waitresses are very attentive. JALAL, OUMAYMA, DHAWI and many others are great at their job, but to be honest in the restaurant,  I couldn't fault any of the staff and their work ethic.   My children regularly stayed in the kids club and the talented MAYA did an excellent job keeping them entertained.   For the price we paid, I didn't expect true 5* quality but we certainly received it. There were people of all backgrounds staying in the hotel and I highly recommend it. If you're going with a family, it's perfect,  but if you're in a couple only or just looking for a fun few days with friends it's great too.  The location is OK. We walked along the beach to the port and it took us 50 minutes (we walked with children, so would be quicker if you're young and fit with no kids!). There are some shops selling souvenirs, a pharmacy, money exchange and a few eateries within walking distance. There are, however, a number of excursions available and dedicated staff who can help to advise you and book this for you.  Finally, we got the best exchange rate at the bank at the port (banks offer the best exchange (post office in Tunisia is ok, too. We were told it's the same rate everywhere, but that's not true!).  I really recommend this hotel, you won't be disappointed!"

        "review_text": "I can't express enough how amazing all the staff were. Every morning we would be greeted with the most amazing and friendly people. Our cleaner Sonia always put a smile on our face and looked after us well.   Nothing was too much for her or Marva. The room was cleaned everyday to perfection. Drinks were always topped up by Ali without fail. I enjoyed seeing them everyday, they would always stop for a chat no matter how busy they were.   The staff at the dining hall were just as good. Nothing was too much. Always served with a smile. The waiters were amazing..we had a toddler with us so as soon as they would see us enter they would get a high chair ready at the table for us. To name a few Khalid and illyas became our regular waiters. They would honour of their way to entertain the toddler (who could sometimes be hard work)  The bar also went the extra mile. We don't drink alcohol they were happy to make alternative drinks. Meeda Meena in particular became very familiar and would soon have non alcoholic drinks ready for us when we went to the bar.  The entertainment team always tried to get everyone involved. They had different entertainment every night to cater for different needs.   Overall from reception staff to each and every staff there I cannot fault the customer service and would definitely return."

        "review_text": "The hotel was clean and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I had booked a standard room, but since we were celebrating a special occasion, I emailed the hotel in advance and asked if it would be possible to get a sea view. They kindly upgraded our room for free, which I really appreciated.  We were a family of three , my husband, our 8-year-old daughter, and I. The beach had beautiful white sand and was perfect for relaxing. There was also a marina about a 30-minute walk away along the beach, which made for a nice outing.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner were served buffet-style. In addition to the buffet, the hotel had two à la carte restaurants — Italian and Tunisian  which required advance booking. Unfortunately, our experience at the Italian restaurant was very disappointing. Despite the restaurant not being particularly busy, there was nearly a one-hour wait between the starter and the main course. We had ordered our steak well-done, but it arrived medium after all that time. While the staff did apologize and replaced it, the delay made it very difficult — especially with a young child.  Other aspects of the hotel also fell short of expectations. The bathtubs in the rooms had been removed and replaced with standing showers, and we were only informed of this a day before our trip. The service overall didn’t feel like five-star quality. While the food offered a lot of variety, it was quite average in taste. Towels were changed daily, but they were old and worn out.  There was a hair salon in the hotel that I definitely do not recommend. I had my hair braided, as I often do on holidays, but the braids started coming undone after just two days. They charged £50, which was expensive, and the next day told me they had undercharged me and asked for more money very unprofessional.  There were entertainment programs every night, but they were very basic and not particularly engaging. The alcoholic drinks were poorly made and low quality.  So, would I return to this hotel? Honestly, no. While there were a few positive aspects, overall it did not meet the standards of a true five-star experience."

That aside we thoroughly enjoy our stay and there’s a lot on offer for families, this is our 2nd stay and we would come back again.  All staff are amazing, it’s a shame we can’t name everyone individually, but special shout to animation team : Yaya and Maya for the kids club / activities and Mira,Lou Lou, Speedy, Cristiano and not forgetting the DJ Steve all deserve 5 stars they make the stay fun and you can’t help but attached to them, it’s sad to say bye but we’ll be back.  As mentioned the room’s need some refurb, cracked tiles etc, but that can be a good overlooked as the cleaning staff keep the rooms very clean and tidy, “Sonia” was our cleaner and greeted us with her wonderful smile daily and the service from her and her team was 5 stars.  Thanks to all the staff bar staff and waiters can’t name you all we felt truly well looked after.  Tesh, Hena & Ethan"

        "review_text": "What an absolutely fabulous hotel and stay. We would highly recommend it and hope to return.   What we enjoyed:   EVERYTHING!   FOOD: was delicious, huge variety for lunch and dinner. Breakfast was decent, and still enjoyable. The best cappuccino I’ve had anywhere (I’m not a coffee drinker). They had several fresh cooking stations, which was a pleasant touch. Lots of space and stations. Something for everyone. They had two other restaurants onsite, a Tunisian and Italian one, which we didn't try, because we really enjoyed the buffets!   ROOM: beautiful, spacious and clean room. Our housekeeping lady Radhia (room 476) was lovely. Always made our room look fresh, with fresh linen and flowers every day. Very comfortable bed and plush pillows.   POOL: was FREEZING lol but that’s to be expected with it being sea water. Go in HOT weather to be able to enjoy the pool. We got good temperature for most our stay. Majid who works poolside serving drinks at sunbeds, was absolutely awesome. Great service with a smile for everyone regardless of background. A very pleasant human.   ENTERTAINMENT: The entertainment team were absolutely fabulous! I absolutely rate their energy considering they run fun activities throughout the day, change, and then run evening entertainment. We really enjoyed the games throughout the day which brought people together from all over for some light-hearted fun and competition. We played darts and French ball. A lot more fun than they sounds! They had so much more. Ask for the entertainment timetable upon check in so you don't miss out on anything you'd fancy.    HOTEL: was beautiful. Clean, comfortable, friendly staff, welcoming and helpful. Private beach access, which was very clean with plenty of beds, and food service nearby, if you don’t want to trek it back to the restaurant inside.   This was our first trip to Tunisia. It’s a very serene, calm and peaceful place from our experience. There’s not lots to do, so you can really kick back and relax in an all inclusive and not feel FOMO. If you do want to explore a little, we would recommend Port El Kantoui, which is a pretty Port area, very close to the hotel. You can go for a stroll along the parade of shops, or take a boat ride. Also would recommend Sousse Grand Mosque and Sousse Medina. A lovely place to visit, and you can pick up a traditional dress at a good price - a traditional LINEN knee length dress is 25 Dinar. Ignore the invites to go into the shops, and you'll save yourself some hassle.   TAXI PRICE GUIDE FROM HOTEL: a 5 minute taxi journey should cost no more than 7 – 10 Dinar. To the Medina, taxi is 20 Dinar. From the airport we paid £25 (UK pound). We got the number of our driver off here. Came recommended. His name is Lassaad. A very respectful and decent honest man. We would highly recommend him too. His contact number is +216 54 463 377. If he is not available, he will send his brother, but sets the price himself so you will not get ripped off.   HOTEL IMPROVEMENTS:  \tTemperature of the food could have been better. Sometimes it was even cold like the donner kebab and roast chicken that were at the live stations  \tTwo of the lifeguards we very unnecessarily rude to us. Once when we asked for mattresses and moments later, we got a very huffy puffy lifeguard when we asked for an umbrella. Note, they provide these services to everyone, but chose to be rude to us for no reason at all, which was very upsetting  \tThere is a clear difference between staff hospitality for the white folk over everyone else, to the point of being obvious. We don’t care for all the excessiveness they do with White folk, if we get our service. But at dinner, you will notice the stark difference. Several times, we had to flag someone down for fizzy drinks, while watching excessive table service for White folk. Not very pleasant to watch  \tTip culture. You almost feel forced to give tips for bits of information you didn’t ask for. As a couple, we actually are generous tippers, but it’s not nice to see people loitering, or holding you back to give you information you didn’t ask for, and then standing there hoping for a tip. Made us uncomfortable on many occasions. Happened across the hotel. We quickly learned to ignore it \tThe hotel is very quality driven. If you give anything less than 5* on any question in the survey at dinner (they bring the tablet to you), expect the staff to get a grilling, which I thought was a bit harsh  \tWater sports team were horrible in their attitude, approach and quite mean, rude and hostile once you’ve purchased an activity. Very cold poker faced approach, which made us uncomfortable considering the had to ensure our safety for the paragliding we did!   We stayed for 5 nights and aside of two bottles of drink upon arrival, and water daily, our mini bar was not filled once.   They put two single beds and mattresses together to make a double. Not ideal if you're travelling as a couple  Hope they take the improvements on board, because it really is an awesome hotel. We loved it otherwise, and hope to return InshaAllah (“.)"

The Tunisian restaurant upstairs is really to avoid, I’m sorry but it was really not good!

The waiters hide to not set you a table .... They serve you in a dirty glass seen with my eyes recovering at the storage table behind us... When there is the welcome cocktail do not expect to have a drink at the bar there are more.... When you have two bedrooms and in both the towels are missing to shower and you manage to have other ones but the moor when the maid makes the room she does not replace her .... No outdoor bar and overall cleanliness very very limited from any point of view. No bar at the beach it is dismantled throughout our stay nor deckchair. When all the staff in general are not friendly and I find a waiter from an old hotel I stayed at the previous year who tells me that he quits because the atmosphere is very bad. Even after worldwide claim tourism does not believe its guests but believe the hotel this is the last time I leave with them no consideration and hotel has fled apsokuously to spend a good family holiday."

        "review_text": "Stayed at the Bel Azur from 10th May for 10 nights with my husband.    First the good, certain bar staff, in fact just one young man who was really nice, we tipped him of course so that may have had something to do with it, the rest of the bar staff were just plain rude, a few staff in the restaurant were nice but thats it I'm afraid, the reception staff were the worst we have ever come across whilst on holiday, so rude and dismissive.    The beach was lovely although we had to clean the sunbeds and table before we sat down each day, no beach snacks available which was a real pain as we didn't want to go in the restaurant for lunch, we wanted to stay on the beach and the pool snack bar only opened at 3pm!! What good is that to anyone??  The food was terrible, cold and the same choice every single day, this is the 1st holiday where we lost weight when we returned home, both of us!....the room was awful, insects in the bed, yes actually between the bedsheets, ants and these small beetle type things all around the floor and in the bathroom, I complained loads of times to reception and I think they did spray the room but they were back hours later so I gave up.  It was disgusting.   The all inclusive was a joke. We couldn't even get a bottle of water without having an argument first, they had water machines with small cups but we wanted a bottle of water to keep in the fridge in our room and another one to take to the beach, it was virtually impossible to get this, as I have said earlier there were no snack bars open at meal times, 3pm is not lunch time! Tea & coffee facilities in the room were also a joke, 2 satchets of coffee per day, so we could only have 1 coffee each per day!! 2 sugar satchets only, No milk provided at all, this was another argument with reception and we ended up with a litre carton of milk, but we shouldn't have to beg for this stuff, WE HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR IT!! when will these hotels realise this??  We definitely would not recommend this hotel, it is nowhere near 4 star, maybe 2 at the most, go to Turkey instead, they do know how to do all inclusive.  Finally,  this hotel is not disabled friendly, there are steps everywhere (52 from reception to the beach), if you are in a wheelchair there is no way you can get to the beach so please bear this in mind."

        "review_text": "We recently stayed at this hotel and had mixed feelings about our experience. On the positive side, the food was very good, the rooms were clean, and the pool was lovely. The beach was absolutely stunning – definitely the highlight of our stay.  Unfortunately, what really let the hotel down was the attitude of the bar staff. Every time my family and I ordered a drink, we were met with rudeness, especially when speaking English. It felt like we were being treated differently, which was upsetting and really affected our holiday experience.  It’s a shame because the hotel itself has a lot going for it. With better customer service at the bar, this could have been a five-star review."

Unfortunately, the experience was completely ruined by the attitude of the staff—especially those working at the bar.  The bar staff were incredibly rude and dismissive, particularly toward English-speaking guests. Basic manners seemed reserved only for those speaking French or Arabic. I felt unwelcome and disrespected every time I tried to order a drink. It was as if serving English speakers was a bother to them.Despite the nice facilities, I would never return or recommend this hotel to anyone who expects respectful, professional service—especially if you speak English.(we are so many nations speaking English)"

        "review_text": "I stayed at this hotel for 7 days and unfortunately, my experience was very disappointing. The staff at both the bar and the reception were generally unfriendly and seemed like they didn’t want to be there. It often felt as though you were invisible unless you gave a tip — only then did the attitude and service noticeably improve.  During our entire stay, the bed linen was never changed — only the towels were replaced. This lack of basic hygiene and attention to housekeeping was unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.  We also reported a leaking tap in the bathroom that was dripping onto the floor. While it was noted by staff, no one ever came to fix it. At night, the floor became dangerously wet, creating a serious slipping hazard. It was only a matter of time before someone could have gotten hurt.  Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel. Poor service, lack of maintenance, and disregard for guest comfort and safety made our stay far below expectations."

        "review_text": "We've recently arrived home from Bel Azur (A group of 4). From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we fully enjoyed our stay here. The hotel was clean, the pool was very inviting. There were a good selection of food to choose from at meal times, as well as pool side snacks during the day. And drinks were very well measured if you like to get tipsy - very easily.  But I'm a lightweight.  All staff couldn't do enough for you. Always greeting you with a smile. You could walk alone within the grounds and beach feeling safe without any worry.   Personally the Animation Team made my holiday. There were plenty going on during the day to join in with. They made their way around the pool to say good morning  to all guests which set your day up feeling happy. A  good personal touch! In the evenings their shows were performed to a high standard, very energetic and fun to watch.  Plenty of dancing too!  I have to say a massive thanks to Roger for all of his hard work. Always putting in 100% and with the running of his team.  A true professional!"

I thought she would be safe and relaxed. I was wrong. She was pestered by Simon the entertainment guy, who was rude, aggressive and unwelcome. I emailed Hotel Guest Relations and was reassured my wife would be safe. When I returned to the hotel, Simon was no longer there, and we were informed he would not return. They offered us some complimentary spa tickets which we didn't use. I notice now on other reviews that Simon is back! Be careful Ladies, watch out for him. His advances are not pleasant. I would never return to this hotel or one of the sister hotels, they seem to employ untrustworthy individuals. The safety of guests not being a concern. This is a shame as I must admit some of the staff were excellent. (Kamil the barman for example)"

We are really looking forward to seeing Simon and his team again, as we have known him from another hotel for almost two years! We are so happy to have met him and feel welcome and supported and would travel anywhere he goes. He has such a friendly, unobtrusive and very helpful manner...my daughter is always very happy about the animation team's t-shirts :)!  All day long you can take part in activities such as Zumba and yoga and dance classes...or table tennis and darts...also volleyball in the summer. But if you just want to watch or relax, you won't be pressured, but it will be accepted and you can watch or just enjoy the peace and quiet.  The special highlight is always the evening shows, in which the team can show off their skills! The management is also very accommodating and helpful. For example, I contacted the hotel in advance to get a specific bungalow with a sea view and was very pleased that it went smoothly. If there were any problems, everyone was very helpful. You just feel very welcome.  I would immediately recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to spend a nice, relaxing holiday, in a very beautiful spot, with a wonderful sea view and with great, friendly staff!❤️"

        "review_text": "A little disappointed with the bad reviews about this hotel , as I have been visiting with my family for more than 20 years each year , I have seen the evolution of this beautiful establishment and if there is one thing that has not changed it is the warm welcome of the staff , the kindness and energy of the entertainment team, the good humor of the lifeguards, the self-calming that the establishment brings ,  I see a lot of complaining about the behavior of the animators things that is totally false, especially the animator Simon who is really a big-hearted and respectful animator, you have to understand that these people remain humans who feel feelings like all of us , sometimes fatigue or personal worries that they can not talk about it we know nothing we are not in their places, I have seen with my own eyes some customers approach the animators in unpleasant ways and especially the animator Simon so we should not expect them to answer you with a smile or be at your command, they are humans and feel things, go in polite ways and with a smile believe me that they will make it x10 and make you have an incredible stay, we have our share of responsibility when we go to an establishment, their job is to entertain us and ours is to facilitate their work and be pleasant, I would like you to learn how to put yourself in the shoes of these people , because working in such a top establishment is not that easy , be smiling at the staff who are in the kitchen , entertainment , reception and beach .  Can’t wait to return this summer so you can spend a pleasant family holiday! And live your own experience without listening to negative reviews!  I would like to tell the Animators to stay as they are and especially the Animator Simon thank you for all these pleasant moments and the time you gave to my family and especially my sister who is autistic as well as the laughter you brought us."

I didn't like the papper cups at breakfast for juices. Lunch and evening meal you had bottle water. For myself not enough serving spoons food was getting picked up by closest server spoon tongs. Bread is hard for toast. Also labeling is not correct says chicken and ws cheese 1 day. Choice between red white wine beer or pop. Plenty salad soups wasnt to my liking bit bland.  Drinks vodka i liked no issues hubby liked beer, they did diet drinks as well as full sugar.   Entertainment was good day and night they didn't pester you if you said no. The animation team are good ..   1 massive thing was they allowed a very ignorent man in hotel always drunk and was swearing and threatening people. I reported him to head manager after a issue.  I was not only person to complain but was over looked and they still gave him beer when he was threatening people and bad language. I was looking over my shoulders all time.

While the staff appears to make an effort, there is a lack of genuine attentiveness and professionalism. Waiting times for service are often long, and inquiries are sometimes ignored or answered reluctantly. The service staff is  friendly.  The food is mediocre at best. The selection is limited, many dishes are bland, and the overall quality feels like mass-produced catering. The atmosphere in the dining area was particularly disturbing: during meals, there was often a lot of noise and unrest. Muslim children ran around the buffet area unsupervised, throwing food on the floor and playing loudly. Unfortunately, the staff did nothing to address the situation, even though it was clearly unpleasant for many guests.  We booked an upgrade for the Starprestigue Room and additional space in the hotel and outside. But even with the upgrade (€€) we felt like a normal guest or even less seen than others. Sure we understand that tips are very common and seen and we also give more when the service ist good at the start (first looking how good the service is). It was not really relaxing sadly. We were like transparent. You don't give since day one something youre out. Sadly. But even with an upgrade - which costs extra - you have no \"extra\" Extra.  In addition, the hotel is in urgent need of renovation. Many areas feel outdated and do not match the standard advertised.  Anyone seeking peace, relaxation, and a premium vacation experience will likely be disappointed. I cannot recommend this hotel and will advise my travel agency to stop recommending it as well."

That was unacceptable; I think this member of staff may have been given a break to eat and decided to help himself. I am sorry for mentioning that as it does matter to all the guests.  At restaurant  waiter I took picture with was excellent  above and beyond of any expectation. I forgot name sorry. Special mention to Abdul , the one always with smile and helpful. My ring donut lady made special effort to make yummy ring donut for me. Tall men at omlate station went extra mile to give good service.   In short most of staff is gems to  hotel. Just want to let everybody to be aware they serve only local alcoholic drinks if one is fussy they bring their own. Waiter who served us drinks yesterday need special mention for his service.  Well done Ibrostar, we will be back."

Najua our housekeeper kept our room very clean with beautiful bed art. Kamel in the star prestige area deserves a shoutout along with Raouf (bartender), MedAli (waiter), Marwen (front desk), Ayman (bar tender in lobby) and Lassad (bar manager), these people have made our holiday and have shown consistency in there service to ensure us a fabulous stay.

        "review_text": "Trip advisor  This was our annual girl’s trip away. On arriving at the hotel we were greeted by Houseem who took care of us during the whole trip. We upgraded to a star prestige room which was lovely. The room had a super king bed, coffee machine, mini bar and had been beautifully cleaned and prepared by Rahma. A Star Prestige room gave you free sun-bed towels, 25% off the spa, private sunbathing area and access to a roof top sunbathing terrace, this also had a hot tub and there were a selection of pastries and sandwiches to help yourself to. Mohamad was on bar duty on the rooftop and looked after all the guests amazingly.   In the buffet restaurant we were looked after by zadine who found us a table each afternoon and evening. The food was great with a variety of different cuisines to choose from. There is also a restaurant which serves Italian or Tunisian menus on different nights, this can get busy so best to book on arrival.  There were a couple of organised trips you could go on- to the Madina, on a catamaran or quad biking. We went on the catamaran. We pre booked the spa in advance as last year it was fully booked and had 2 treatments during our stay and made full use of the gym and swimming pool.  Each evening a different cocktail was served in the bar and entertainment was put on.  A huge shout out to our waiters Aymen and Oussama, they were great and looked after us during our stay  A huge thank you to the staff. This was the second year we have stayed here and  yet again we had an amazing time. We have already started looking for our visit for next year. See you all in 2026 xx"

Second, Yassine by the pool looked after us and kept bringing us drinks without even asking. Next was Abdelaziz and Hitchem in the restaurant who were lovely and so friendly. Next we want to mention the food, the chefs really cooked outstanding food, we were amazed how the lamb, beef and chicken were cooked perfectly especially when it was batched cooked! (There are plenty of veg options such as salad bar, vegan corner etc) The food that stood out was the Tunisian food and sweets. The all inclusive drinks had a very large choice including alcoholic and non alcoholic to cater everyone. Entertainment were very hard working and didnt badger you if you didnt want to join. One small criticism is we hoped for more Tunisian inspired shows etc and less of cruise ship inspired acts. Overall, a wonderful holiday we did not want to end and we will definitely be back to Tunisia in the future. À bien tôt!"

        "review_text": "What can I say AMAZING . Just returned from a week’s holiday here and what an amazing experience we had. The hotel is clean and tidy. The rooms are basic but you don’t spend much time in them so it’s ok. The food was lovely, something for everyone. I do advise you to bring your own cups as they serve you soft drinks in tiny paper cups. The waiting staff are absolutely amazing. So attentive and kind. Giving them a small tip for their service made them treat us like VIP’s. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Treat with respect to be treated with respect. As for the animation team, FANTASTIC. They are so welcoming and super friendly. They go all out for the guests, chatting and getting you to get involved. They are amazing with children, doing kids dances every evening letting them be on the stage dancing while they stand on the dance floor doing the actions making the children the stars of the show, Joe, Eddi, Rio, Leo just to name a few, ABSOLUTELY AWESOME.  There was a man called Amid who sold trips on a pirate ship, camel treck, quads etc, who was really lovely. The pirate ship was the highlight of my holiday. Thanks Amid x Overall the holiday was FANTASTIC. I am ready looking to book again. Thank you guys for the perfect holiday xx🇹🇳"

To be told that it was fine and then when I got there 1 day into my trip I had a security man who was a piece of work himself turn up at my room door to take my drone off me. He then got the police involved even though he lied and said he didn’t. The guest relations manager Abir told us it was him and he’s a horrible human. I ended up having my drone seized and Abir has since ignored all my messages as I needed police details for my insurance claim. As for the hotel, the food was average and the rooms was dirty!"

The new animation teal they bought in after sacking the old ones are so bad they don't interact with guests or put on shows all they do is let the guests participate every night karaoke/female beauty pageant/men v women that's all they do. Maybe the male members of team should spend less time bedding the female guests which  I saw.  Now the reception staff the worse I've ever come across in my life the women especially yesterday telling me to go take shower at pool as I had vacated room at 12 and didn't fly till v late I was very upset to b spoken to like that at 65 absolutely no respect for women. Eventiyhe asst manager came to help resolve problem. The best thing bout this hotel is the food in restaurant the best choice I've ever had.will I be returning here NEVER and not will any of the other English guests I spoke to but I suppose the hotel not bothered by ENGLISH not returning"

The only issue at the beginning was that the room was warm, but they said the a/c wasn't turned on until June 1st. After I got a small fan, the room was very comfortable! The biggest plus at the Riadh Palms for me was the staff there. They were so welcoming and friendly! Fadhel who worked at reception and handled currency exchange was super nice and helpful for me, especially when I couldn't get the TV remote to work. Also, Isra, who worked as a hostess at the hotel restaurant couldn't have been more kind!! During my 6 day stay there I mostly had Ali, Anwar, and Anas as my waiters at the hotel restaurant and all 3 were so kind and entertaining and attentive to any needs I had. Great job! Lastly, Ola and Odel, who both worked in the reception area were very kind, and Ola helped me set up an excursion to the city of Kairaoun. I highly recommend this hotel!"

        "review_text": "Riadh Palms Living it up in the ghetto   Come out the hotel front and your on the street Beach is dirty covered In glass and fag buts Sea water is dirty have to swim out to get to clean water  Confirmed by staff and holidaymakers the hotel is run by the mafia Fights break out between holidaymakers - one fight happened and they had to pay £500 to not get the authorities involved (witnessed in Zino bar which is situated in the hotel) Cocaine sold by the taxi driver out front and two men stationed around the pool that will offer you “anything you want they can get”  Offers free WiFi yet you can’t get onto it, you’ll need to buy a Tunisian SIM card £13 for 27gb First lot of animation staff were fired due to misconduct I.e. selling drugs for the “wrong” opposite cartel Offers a key safe in your room however you have to pay for the key 20dinar You have a tv but have to pay for the remote which doesn’t have English channels bar 2 news channels  Cleaners leave your balcony door unlocked and slightly open as they put kids on the roof to go into your rooms and steal your belongings - floors 1 and 2. Cleaners will also use anything you have out, I.e. make up, deodorant, and even take your tablets you have out They will also let themselves into your room at random moments tell you they have a bad back indicating they want a tip, even when the rooms been cleaned they still “pop in” for no reason whatsoever  Prepare yourself for the same playlist of music, one for the day time and one for the evening Evening entertainment isn’t amazing, my niece and nephew could choreograph a dance better than the animation team  Lots of flies, apparently they bite, either that or bedbugs but I daren’t lift the mattress cover up (what you don’t know doesn’t always hurt, unless you get bitten)  “You wont go hungry people say”, salad bar is good, breakfast it’s good so just stock up on that, hotdogs are alright, burgers are undercooked and the meat is questionable.  If you hate the smell of cigarettes avoid it. If you’re looking for a holiday stay that replicates a Temu version of Butlins - go for it. It’s as if everyone’s saved up their universal credit to come abroad. It’s “cheap” for a reason.  Male staff pester you constantly asking you for your number and social media tags, had to put ring on wedding finger to pretend to be married even though that didn’t make a difference  No doesn’t mean no here (if you know what I mean).  Avoid coming here as a solo traveller avoid coming here as a group of females - it’s not safe, I’ve had a chair against my door every evening (I told a staff member at the front desk and he said it’s because I am “beautiful”, not the best response I must admit.  Air conditioning doesn’t come on until July as it’s “not hot enough”, it’s been 30-33 degrees Celsius   Minority of staff are friendly and helpful (people in the food hall), the rest are unhelpful, speak to you disgustingly, the rest clearly hate the British (which I can see why as so many I have witnessed are rude and aggressive) & clearly don’t want to work here let alone want to help you Reception staff are as much use as a chocolate teapot and will walk away or do something so they don’t have to deal with you or your query you may have  Last point, there isn’t an “on the beach” holiday rep and the “love holidays” rep is MIA as mentioned by holiday makers who booked through love holidays   Genuine review from a genuine person from the UK - my stay was 17/05 to 24/05 & I will be claiming compensation off of on the beach for the troubles and stress this holiday has caused me."

        "review_text": "Basically a nice hotel with friendly staff, spacious rooms and good space at the pool. But the stay was marked by wear, lack of maintenance, unmanaged beach, low-season atmosphere and lack of sense for the details that create a 5-star experience.  The hotel's building and common areas are architecturally beautiful and gave a nice first-hand impression. The room was spacious, quiet and was done properly clean every day, creating a relaxed base during the stay. The pool area is large and nice to stay at, and although there were no play facilities, there was plenty of room for children to swim and play. Pool staff were friendly and attentive. The same was true of the restaurant staff, who were helpful and welcoming, also toward children. The children’s club was quiet, but the staff there was really sweet and caring – and created a safe experience for my child. It worked well that you could collect payments through the room bill, and overall I experienced the hotel staff as friendly and service minded in the meeting face to face.  The hotel seemed worn out and marked by a lack of sense for the small details that distinguish a luxury hotel from an ordinary resort. The beach area was a big disappointment: The beach chairs were worn and in trouble, and the beach – although it is beautifully located and close to the hotel – was filled with dungeons and camellot. There was no beach bar at the family beach, only at the adult area, and the beach seemed generally unarranged and sad.  We booked a pirate boat trip through the hotel, which my son was looking forward to. However, the ship turned out to be the dullest one we saw in the harbor – without any decorations or details, and it did not seem clean. My son had a nice experience, but looked long after the other, much nicer ships.  Communication with the hotel prior to the stay also did not work optimally. Our messages via Booking.com were not answered, and even the day after arrival I had to point out the services I had booked from home – even though it was the hotel itself that had sent the offers.  The area around the hotel was also boring and isolated. One had to take a taxi to get into Houmt Souk, where there were restaurants and life. There were no cafes, shops or city life within walking distance, making the stay a little monotonous – especially if you travel without a car.  The whole was marked by a low season and a general feeling that the hotel had not yet gotten up in gear – and that it needed a complete renovation."

And then the horror starts, we lived in room 4105, apparently a mouse or other animal died in the vent, if you turn on the air conditioner for a long time, then on your return the corpse smell, okay, you can keep the air conditioner on, then ok. Beds, furniture, pillows, curtains and everything else is clean, but very, very old, everything is stuccoed, and already just throw away, impossible to use.  It concerns everything, elevator, sunbeds on the beach, towels there, umbrellas , ace just need to throw away!!! By the way no one ever cleans the beach, okay the sand was leveled, the algae garbage has not been removed, but the whole beach is complete!!!! In the faeces of camels and horses (they ride tourists on the beach) no one!!! It doesn't.  The staff just don't want anything, nobody's even trying to do anything.  Spa separate story for 80 € is the worst massage imaginable!!! And the spa itself is dirty and long in need of repair. So it's not a 5* or a 4* that's probably a 3*--' breakfast by the way also leaves a lot to be desired.  You should avoid this place!!!"

The hope of seeing a well-run hotel worthy of its setting and stars is finally there.  The staff who for so many years have put their kindness at the service of the guests to make them feel good and have a pleasant stay despite this permanent drop in the quality of the services provided by the hotel.  No doubt this kindness of heart and dedication of all those who work at the Radisson Blu Hotel will be put at the service of the new manager, of whom they certainly expect a lot, to help him succeed in this huge mission of restoring the hotel to the top level.  Good luck to you all. As for the thalasso, its evolution started several years ago continues, contributing to make it one of the most efficient and varied unfortunately little known. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all those who helped make this very special stay for me, a wonderful stay for us."

        "review_text": "Our stay at this hotel was unfortunately a consistently disappointing experience. The hygienic conditions were unacceptable: So we were served drinks bottles that had bird droppings on them, and the tiles in the room were also damaged. The indoor pool was heavily polluted and looked very run-down overall. Also the cleanliness of the room left much to be desired, as fresh towels were often only provided after multiple requests.  The culinary offer also did not meet our expectations. The food was low quality and the choice in the all-inclusive offer very limited. We also had to pay additional fees for almost all other services, even though we had booked all-inclusive. There were only two ways to get free drinks, which were also only open at certain times.  The experience at the à la carte restaurant was particularly disappointing. We were assured a voucher for dinner after a conversation with the hotel management, but this was not accepted during our visit. Instead, we only received a limited menu, as is also offered to regular all-inclusive guests. Our demand was ignored and we felt mistreated overall.  Also at the reception we received no support in solving our problems. Finally, we had to go to the buffet restaurant with our children, where they suddenly paid conspicuous attention to our table after our situation had probably become known.  Another problem was the defective elevator, which made it very difficult to use the hotel with a stroller on the third floor.  Overall, this stay was a great disappointment. Our expectations for a relaxing holiday have been far exceeded, and we have felt greatly frustrated by the repeated shortcomings and poor service. We can not recommend this hotel."

Congratulations to Assia, Ayda and Essia. The service at the bar (Lahzar in the morning and Houcine in the evening) is excellent. The buffet is varied and changes daily. The rooms are nice and large. Points of improvement should be noted: wine list to review. Wine ageing and not up to standard. The Tunisian restaurant Flamingo is a disappointment. The service was slow and disorganized. Cleaning in the rooms is done quickly. No vacuum cleaners, so carpets aren't made... The spa and treatments are very nice.  Note that we were able to take 2 beautiful horseback rides with Mohsen (independent) on the beach in front of the hotel. He is trusted and his horses are well fed and treated.  The pool is huge and the staff is helpful, offering towels, deckchairs and cushions at will.  Evening entertainment (concert) is not exceptional."

We arrive very late in the evening because delay of the flight, my friend being ill she must eat. They're bringing us two plates so far, everything goes, carrot salad cucumbers a miserable slice of je ne sais quoi, no shabby brief seasoning. The next day we look for ourselves or go to lunch because the friendliness of the people at the reception does not make you want to ask anything....  Now let's talk about the wifi...no wifi accessible in the room..the wifi is only at the reception and around the pool still you have to choose the right place...then the high speed wifi announcement is only a lie.  Now let's talk about the bedroom , the wardrobe smells musty, the bedroom smells old, an unpleasant smell.  Cleaning is not the passion of this hotel, disgusting windows not only in the room but everywhere in the commons.  On the balcony two miserable dirty chairs, a rotten table cracked a rotten mini dryer where you can put nothing on it .....  The room with both beds this remains just a pretty clean place.  The toilet and the bathroom I don't talk about it...u. dry hair that must date because crack and it can burn hands.  Cockroach meets in the toilet.....  Now let's talk about the indoor bar... unpleasant waiters no sympathy.  Pool not heated but clean finally a positive.  The buffet was at least good and varied as well as lunch there I can say nothing again.  Atmosphere had to look for her in the hotel next door....just one nice evening in the hotel with a singer.  Hotel is old.  The view from the room on a huge open waste site brief ...."

        "review_text": "Terrible Experience – Do Not Recommend  I stayed at Hotel Sol Azur Beach and Congres in Hammamet for 14 days, and unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst holiday of my life.  Despite booking an all-inclusive package, basic necessities like bottled water were not provided. You had to beg for each bottle, and the staff often reacted rudely. The hotel was dirty, and the photos online are completely misleading — the reality is far from what is advertised.  The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful, and to make matters worse, 200€ was stolen from our room. When we reported it, no one took any responsibility, and there was no support or compensation offered.  We also experienced frequent power outages in our room and the air conditioning didn’t work at all, which made it unbearable, especially in the heat.  The only positive aspect of this stay was the good food and the fresh watermelon, which we genuinely enjoyed. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to make up for the overall poor experience.  This stay was incredibly disappointing and stressful. What was meant to be a relaxing vacation turned into a complete nightmare. I strongly advise others to avoid this hotel — it is absolutely not worth the money."

Sewage smell every time you walk to the beach  Little to non security people coming of the streets stealing drinks and other personal items  Cleaners don’t know how to knock even then will still walk in whilst having a shower Drinks are just not nice. Just the cheapest you can find For the first couple days you will be like a lost dog. Don’t even try and read the map as it’s just very outdated as well as everything else"

There was a great choice of food, well cooked & the dining area was clean & all waiting staff very friendly & efficient. Some bedrooms were probably a bit dated but the hotel is doing refurbishments & ours was clean. The animation team were marvellous, we go on a few hols a year & these guys are one of the best we've seen in awhile, their energy is great. Probably one downside they could do with a few more public toilets around the complex."

The Aquagym course is top. We're laughing really good. In the evening the entertainment is very good too, no time to be bored. The only demolishment is that in early June the aquapark is still closed (check the opening of the park). The food is not bad but maybe a little effort can be made at this level. Basically recommend this hotel. The housekeepers are also very adorable. Top top top, we'll probably come back as a family again."

A huge thank you especially to Habib Hamouda for his welcome, human warmth, availability and kindness ❤️. He was more than just a staff member: he witnessed our happiness to my partner and I. ✨💍A memory forever etched in our hearts... Thank you, Habib, for sharing this emotion with us.  Small downside though on the cleaning in the room, which would have deserved a little more attention.  And for a 4-star, it would be really nice to find a small bottle of fresh water when we arrive in the room — a simple little gesture, but one that makes all the difference... Despite these details, it did not spoil the beauty of our stay.  I highly recommend this place, and hope to return very soon! ☀️"

        "review_text": "The hotel is OKAY… Came and will never come back.  CONS:  1. The plates and cups were dirty—it was disgusting. Even the tables had crumbs all over them and weren’t cleaned properly.  2. Rubbish was everywhere, even near the beach.  3. I lost a shirt, and one of the women staff members was extremely rude. She didn’t even check the lost property properly.  4. The cleaning lady came every day but didn’t actually clean. Towels weren’t changed, and bedsheets stayed the same. The room also had a weird smell.  5. The mattress was so rough, it felt like sleeping on a rock.  6. Flies were literally everywhere—on the food, on me, and on my family members.  7. Kids were taking fruit with their bare hands, and nothing seemed hygienic.  8. When I was diving in the pool, I saw tissues floating in the water—disgusting!  9. The food was either half-raw or the same boring thing every day. It also smelled weird. I got diarrhea from it.  10. There were mosquitos during the evening shows, and they were biting us.  11. The door to our room connected to another room, and we had to block it with a lamp to feel safe.  12. The walls were super thin—you could hear everything from the next room.  13. The beach view was beautiful, but the sand wasn’t clean. I even saw horse poo in the sea.  14. The camel man near the beach was pushy. He didn’t grab me aggressively, but he gently took my arm and helped me onto the camel without telling us the price. My dad kept asking, but the man ignored us and kept talking about activities.  15. There’s also a guy inside the hotel walking around with a book, trying to sell activities. He was very pushy and wouldn’t leave us alone unless we said “later.”  16. The slides and pool area were closed, which was the main reason I chose this hotel. Tip to the hotel: Next time, say clearly on your website when the slides open—and make it clear it’s not actually part of the hotel.  17. The internet was terrible. You could only get a signal in the lobby, and even that barely worked.  18. The music at the night shows was way too loud—it hurt my ears and gave me a headache.  19. There was no gym  PROS:  1. The ocean was absolutely beautiful—blue, warm, and amazing to swim in (ignoring the rubbish nearby).  2. The Bazaar near the hotel was colourful and fun to walk through (though the sellers were a bit too clingy and tried to force us to buy things).  3. The Crocodile Farm was fantastic! So many crocodiles and turtles, a great museum, cheap tickets, and I even got to hold a baby crocodile. Definitely worth visiting—it was just 7 minutes away.  4. Taxis were cheap and very convenient.  5. Most of the local people were kind.  6. It was hot and sunny when I went (in May).  7. The shrimp was tasty, and there were plenty of fresh fruits like watermelon.  Overall: I would definitely go back to Djerba because the place itself is nice—but I would never go back to this hotel. I’ll be choosing a better one next time."

We had a couple of issues with the room (a leaking pipe) but they were resolved very quickly.   The food was delicious and although there were some staples it was not repetitive like you would find in many places. The food was delicious, hot and very varied.   The animation team ensured that everyone who wanted to take part in activities did so but they were not overbearing. I thoroughly enjoyed the morning yoga and aqua gym and my husband and children loved the darts and table tennis tournaments. We didn't catch any of the nightly entertainment but always looked to be busy and people were enjoying themselves.    We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.  Thank you for a wonderful, relaxing and peaceful holiday!   The stables are an excellent addition, very reasonably priced and the horses were beautiful, and all very well cared for."

Archery at 16:00 with Zezu and Omar, never played it before and really enjoyed it! I had my nails done in the spa which was a nice great, manicure and pedicure. A friend said she'd enjoyed a full body 2hr massage adhd it was the best she'd ever had! The weather was variable when we were there but the spa pool is lovely and warm so a bit of cloud on a cooler day means you can still enjoy the water. Entertainment, food, drinks, gorgeous setting, we couldn't have asked for more! One l'il tip. There are coffee making facilities but only powdered milk, which changes the taste but it still looks like you're drinking black coffee. You can get cartons of milk from the shop up the road, a short walk away.   Thank you for having us!   P.S please leave the swift nests up, I was really sad to see one had been knocked down while we were there, but the clever birds rebuilt it!"

        "review_text": "First of all, I would like to congratulate you on the change and improvements made since our last visit. Since our arrival and as usual the welcome was more than warm. We were received wonderfully well and on this occasion I would like to thank from the bottom of my heart all the staff working in the different sectors for their kindness, dedication and know-how. the rooms were clean and very well maintained every day. The restaurant offers a choice and a range of delicious and varied food and meals. In short, the services in the various corners of the hotel were up to what we expected. During the days, my children were not bored quite the contrary they feasted on the different entertainment activities presented by the Mini club team and especially by Mrs Mouna whom my children found warm and friendly. My wife and I also attended a show every Friday where we had the pleasure of dancing to beautiful musical masterpieces performed and sung tonight by the hotel’s outstanding and splendid voice artist. Finally, a big thank you again! I can only wish you a very good continuation on everything you do."

        "review_text": "AVOID LIKE the PLAGUE! We were all bad the first week as were many other guests we had got talking too! Staff really rude and ignorant! Breakfast dinner and tea was the same every single night! Not even a chicken nugget or fish fingers for the kids! Cereal was stale every morning too! Staff stand and stare at you while eating, some standing right behind you while your eating! Made me feel really uncomfortable. Ordered panini at snack bar French lady came and ordered after me soo the worker stopped making my panini and served the French lady first! Overall food, drinks and snack bar is disgusting I was going to the shop over the road for some super noodles that’s how poor the food is! Cocktails are vile too.  ENTERTAINMENT  very poor nothing on same shows repeated every few days had football on for 3 nights in a row and stopped all the kids party dances for these nights.  ROOM cleaners were lovely and room was cleaned everyday however the passage and our room stunk of sewage! You only get 1 key card so can’t leave nothing charging while your out! Beds very uncomfortable our shower was also broke no drinks in the fridge which I was surprised at giving it’s a 4 star hotel!  Staff hang around you waiting for tips constantly!  Only positive I have is muna and the 2 young girls at kids club they went out their way to play with my daughter at the park and on an evening. They are the only staff that have manners and respect for their guests unlike the others! So big Thankyou to the 3 girls  We left the resort once and we were told put your phone away otherwise you will be robbed I’ve never felt more unsafe on a holiday in my life was counting down the days to go home Overall I would not return didn’t feel safe or welcome here. This hotel is not a 4 star more a 2/3!"

        "review_text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ The Best Hotel in Hammamet — and Here’s Why!  We stayed for 7 days in suites 1362 and 1363. While 1362 doesn’t have the best view (though you still get a glimpse of the sea), 1363 offers a stunning panoramic view of the pool and the beach — absolutely gorgeous.  From the moment we arrived, the service was outstanding. Every single staff member greeted us with a smile and genuine helpfulness. It would be impossible to name everyone who contributed to making our stay perfect, but a few truly stood out and deserve a special mention:  Check-in: The front desk team was welcoming, cheerful, and incredibly helpful. You feel the warmth as soon as you step into the lobby.  Rooms: Spotlessly clean, and serviced perfectly every day — from morning refresh to turndown. Special shoutout to Abdallah, who went above and beyond to ensure every little detail was taken care of.  Housekeeping: Bahja was a lifesaver! She helped me get three pairs of pants hemmed — super quickly and with a smile. When I lost a precious bracelet, she turned the room upside down to help me find it — literally checking every sheet, cushion, and corner. Her kindness and dedication were remarkable.  Breakfast: Every morning started with a bright smile from Lobna, who sets the tone for a joyful day. And the omelets? Hands down the best in town, made by Olfa, with fresh ingredients and always that same warmth and perfection. Sahbi, our morning waiter, remembered our drinks and preferences from Day 1 — no reminders needed, just seamless and personalized service.  Dining – Adra Restaurant: A must-try for local Tunisian specialties. Their “Loup Malfouf” was exceptional — fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Adel and Mr. Malaoui made every dinner a joy with their attentiveness and contagious smiles.  Spa: This hotel houses the only Clarins Spa in Tunisia — and it’s a gem. Guests have free access to the hammam and pool, and I enjoyed two deeply relaxing massages by Sirine, whose hands truly work magic.  Transfer: We opted for a private Jaguar transfer from and to the airport, traveling with my Super Dad. With onboard Wi-Fi, I managed to get some work done — freeing up more quality time once we arrived.  Throughout our stay, every single team member was kind, accommodating, and happy to help — whether it was taking photos or assisting with special requests.  We’re already planning our return!  PS: We challenged ourselves to a wild goal — walking from the hotel to the Medina every day. Final count? 128 km in 7 days. Because when you stay somewhere this energizing, even the challenges feel joyful. You can check our progress in video on my IG account @ valerieorsoni"

I just had 2 ceaser salads delivered to the room ($60 or so US) that I’ve had to send back and now I’m going to bed hungry. Ordered a steak yesterday, paid the $40 and left it on the plate. Going on a five star holiday is senseless if the food is inedible.   The internet has not been working. I’ve missed 3 days of work. They brought a new router today but it’s too late.   The staff is lovely but it doesn’t matter if you go on a holiday and, despite being willing and happy to pay whatever price, you can’t get anything edible and you can’t complete obligatory tasks. I wish I could go home early. We’ve had maybe 9 dishes so far and not one has been actually good. Burgers are tying us over, but my god why would I go on a holiday to stay barely satiated to get by. I’m not a picky eater with this in mind, it’s just not good.   I’m ready to leave."

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed into a calm and elegant atmosphere. The spa, as always, was top-notch  a peaceful escape with a skilled team and a soothing environment. What really caught our eye this time, though, was a charming young man by the pool and beach area. He carried himself with such ease and grace — always well-groomed, polite, and genuinely attentive. The way he introduced himself and engaged with guests was subtle yet professional, and didn’t go unnoticed. Working in hospitality ourselves, we recognise the difference between routine service and real dedication. This young man clearly cares. A sincere thank you to the whole La Badira team for maintaining such high standards."

        "review_text": "Quick summary.  Not so good bits - Rooms dated. Beds were firm (I struggled to sleep). Restaurant temporarily runs out of plates mid service (little frustrating).  Good bits - Pool areas and private beach area fantastic. I found the range of food really good during lunch and evening (however breakfast was really limited for anyone with an english breakfast expectation). All the staff seemed friendly and decent. The entertainment crew were also fantastic and really do make a difference around the pool during the day 👍🏻 Option to use the sister hotel (The Occidental) pool and slide facilities (and the all inc pool bar) Few shops and Pharmacy within a five minute walk as well as a few restaurants all reasonably priced.   In all honesty I would not class it as a 4 star more a 3.5, but I think holiday companies now base the star ratings on the features available and not the quality of the facilities etc. This may just be me.   What I will say is although with everything summarised we had a great holiday and made the most of what we had and what we were offered.   We also booked two excursions from the local provider in the hotel (Alibarba), we did Camel riding and quad bikes. Both great value for money (expect to get mega dusty on the quad bikes and take sun glasses. We took age range 8 to 60 on both trips and all enjoyed them.   If you book here I hope your overall experience is as good as ours 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻   We came at the end of May and had between 26 and 32 temp throughout the 10 days, all sun no clouds (apart from one random down which was overcast with showers).  Over all great holiday 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"

        "review_text": "Upon arrival, my partner realised he left his rucksack on the transfer and the reception staff were amazing and called the bus company to arrange for them to drop it off, making several calls throughout the day to sort this for us. The room is adequate. The beds are large but the mattresses a little firm as well as the pillows. The air conditioning practically useless, however we have been told by other travellers that the hotel will not switch it on until June 1st. The pool bar is a great feature although the pool itself is slightly on the small side and according to our teenage children; not deep enough. There is an idiot pool at the sister hotel next door (Occidental) which is deeper, however it is very stuffy in there. When you are sat around the pool you do get a lot of different staff walking around trying to sell you treatments and trips and you have to be firm when you do not want them as they will return and continue to ask. We have not used the gym so cannot comment, however looking at it from outside; it looks very modern and is always in use. The spa is very relaxing and the treatments are great; however you are asked several times that you leave a good tip.  Drinks are pretty standard for all inclusive. Food has been one of the best all inclusive we have experienced. There have been traditional staples daily plus a good variety of other dishes suitable for both adults and fussy children. One evening, the restaurant even provided live entertainment in the form of a saxophonist, alongside a feast of sushi and fresh fish dishes. The staff in the restaurant are incredible, they make an effort to get to know your drinks order and sit you at the same table and cannot do enough for you. The entertainment throughout the day is your usual mix of water aerobics and competitions such as darts and archery for the whole family. The evening shows have been mostly outdoors in the sister hotel and have consisted of mini disco and a show afterwards. Not all have been great, however the entertainment team are always incredible. They are engaging with everyone and bring a lot of fun and energy."

        "review_text": "Stayed at Marhaba club in Sousse. The hotel is not 4 star, 3 at best. Rooms are old, tired and dated, bathroom has tiles and discoloration to edge of bath and inside. Beds are not double but 2 singles pushed together. Food is edible but limited everything is repeated daily, the egg/omelette station is below par and the juices are terrible not fresh at all artificial tasting and really disappointing. The all inclusive alcohol was like water they used the cheapest vodka/rum/gin and brandy they have in their supermarket which I saw was 17 dinar (£4.20) and you cannot feel the effects. The gin isn't gin tastes like vodka and the glasses they provide are about 250ml. People bought large cups to get it filled. Deposit of £12 for the towel per one needed to be paid. We bought towels from gift shop as was only £3.50. and kept. One of the annoying things was in the morning before 9am cleaners will come in the room even if sleeping to take the towels away (have no idea why). Not to clean room. We would come back after breakfast room not clean and towels not back until late afternoon every day. No do not disturb sign either. They didn't clean the rooms they made bed and emptied bins. There was hot chocolate stain on table for 4 days up until we left that wasn't wiped off. Mosquitos so bring repellent as air conditioning not switched on until June. The access to swimming and gym is at the Occidental hotel which is a bit of a walk away. The snacks were a few cakes at the lobby. The beach bar serves no spirit just beer and wine On the positive the people were nice and attentive, entertainment was ok. If you like table tennis bring your own balls as you would hardly find any."

Kept me awake until 2.30am. Bring some earplugs and ask for a room nowhere near this and you will have a great time. Very clean everywhere and again all staff fantastic"

        "review_text": "Holiday in Marhaba Club resort is a real treat. Rooms are clean,with new towels every day. Staff always happy smiling and ready to help people to enjoy their holiday to fullest, going extra mile and advice on anything. Food is what you expect on all inclusive holiday, enough variety of different kind of foods and treats including ice cream at lunch and dinner time to satisfy anyone. Animation team on our side 3 lovely guys Rico,Mino and Tores joined by some other lovely animators at times are amazing, engaging and hard working people who entertain guests by the pool every day with games, activities and pool parties. Putting up entertaining show every night. Some in hotel lobby some bigger shows outside on other side of complex. Now I would like to comment on some negative reviews I seen before I visited. I did not experience any of stuff some people write in those,to the point I have to ask why people like this even go holidays. Hotel resort is beautiful and right at beachfront,just the short walk on path leading via resort will easily lead you there. Some people don't appreciate good place and hard work hotel staff do even if they were given holiday for free. Of course with busy place like this you will have to sometimes wait few minutes to get cuttlery on your table and plates don't just vanish the second you finish eating and who cares if there is no tea bags in the room. There are some buildings around currently not in use,but they obviously work on renovations and improvements there same as painting everything to make sure place looks nice and clean, I see management walking around planing where and what needs to be done,but it doesn't just happen over night logically. The people who work here are on their feet 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, have to deal sometimes with grumpy and rude guests,as I experienced on my own eyes. And that's the kind of people who write bad reviews. I was on few different holidays in different countries but this place convinced me to come back with my family. So big thanks to all staff in the hotel,you are doing great job."

Wael at the beach bar was truly amazing and always went above and beyond.  Rio was just the best entertainment and really did make our holiday even better, always making us laugh and we always enjoyed seeing him.  The food was 10/10!!! So much choice, I am normally fussy and end up eating pizza and chips but I actually loved their food so much.  Cocktails are lovely too and spirits always good measurements.  Coffee shop with iced lattes and milkshakes etc!  Loved the entertainment every single night, was so good.  Needed milk for our toddler and gave us 2 cartons straight away.  Honestly couldn’t have had a better holiday, definitely recommend.  Thank you TUI Blue Manar, we will be back!!🫶🏼"

The kids foam party was one of the most fun things our children have ever done on holiday and so well organised and manned. Staff were always kind friendly and welcoming, Ziko from the entertainment was brilliant and the beach security Rafik, his colleagues and life guards went above and beyond to accommodate us, have fun with our kids and provide fantastic service. Food was a little repetitive but always great quality and selection, pastries were incredible and a cheese panini from the sandwich corner was always a winner at lunchtime. Dinner at the Baia restaurant was also phenomenal, couldn’t fault it. Can’t wait to return to tui blue manar!"

        "review_text": "Dear Mr Walid Gharbi,  Thank you very much for our enjoyable holiday in Tui Blue Manar. Ananda B has written a review, 5 star, for the family experience (family of 8, 4 double rooms). I would like to comment on one unpleasant aspect encountered in the hotel. We took the trip to Bazar Tapis La Brise that was offered by the one of the two vendors who operate in the grounds of the hotel. Points to note: 1) The vendor made out he was associated with the hotel - not true. 2) Vendor stated that hotel cars would be used for transport - not true, two UNSAFE private vehicles were used. 3) Vendor stated that visit was to a carpet factory - not true, visit was to a shop. 4) Vendor stated that factory was Government owned - not true, a private shop. 5) Vendor stated that Bedouin women would be viewed making carpets - not true. One women in the shop gave very short demonstration. 6) After our visit I found that the shop had one star reviews from French tourists stating their bad experience. Shop name Bazar Tapis La Brise in Hammamet. 7) After our visit I reported the above to the Tui representative who then discussed this with her manager. 8) On the following day I was approached and questioned by the vendor in an unfriendly, intimidating manner (something had been said to him by the hotel). Due to this I did not raise the issue further until I was safely home. A good hotel full of very pleasant and friendly staff let down by one vendor (tout) allowed to operate in the hotel grounds.  My strong advise to guests is do not engage with the tout and do not go on the carpet tour. If you want a Tunisia carpet go to a reputable shop. Mr. Walid Gharbi, thank you for our stay in your hotel and I will let you consider the tout who adds nothing but takes away a lot. Best regards Robert B"

Food in glut tasteless not seasoned! I've never seen so much garbage thrown away by waiters, especially scavengers! The wine is undrinkable! The restaurant is unworthy of a so-called 4.5 star!

Snack bar and sandwich corner was great to grab some food if you're by the pool or beach.   Pools were so clean and nice, foam party was so much fun.   Beach was immaculate, soft white sand and clear blue water.    Our rooms was spotless, house keeping came and cleaned everyday and done an excellent job.   Entertainment was great, 7 year old loved it.   We left the resort twice to go to yasmine and Naubel, reception called taxi for us each time, always felt safe and loved exploring.   We were so sad to leave, but booking to come back in september. We have found our new home <3"

        "review_text": "On May 21st, I walked into this hotel after a taxi dropped me off at the main entrance. I respectfully approached the reception desk and asked to book a room (or two) for myself and my family, explaining that we wanted to move in immediately as our previous hotel was not comfortable.  The receptionist confirmed room availability for May 21–24 and asked me to wait. Then he disappeared. Minutes later, a security guard approached me politely and escorted me out of the hotel, saying that bookings must be made in advance online or through a travel agency.  I was shocked. The receptionist could have simply told me that instead of disappearing and having me escorted out. I was respectful, well-dressed, and gave no reason for such treatment.  Was this because I’m Arab? I can’t help but wonder.  Sadly, this experience was humiliating and far from the hospitality one would expect in Tunisia. I’m sharing this so future guests are aware and prepared in case they encounter similar behavior."

        "review_text": "Myself, my daughter and 2 year granddaughter arrived at this hotel supposedly a 5 star around 11.00 a.m Got there told to put my luggage to one side, go to the plush looking reception, greeted my cold looking unhappy faces, no welcome drink, no real greeting told to complete a form what for not sure why, given wristband, told to go to another side to pay 27 dinars again what for they said service, what service, anyway i paid this and was told to wait for room but go and have lunch at 12.30 and come back to reception to try key for the room. Nearly two hours later I get room 929, disgusting disgusting disgusting. Go downstairs made complaint no more rooms to give us and check them the next day for a swap. By then I'm fuming my daughter who has anxiety was in a state that I had to try and calm down and encouraged her that we will get a decent room next day. Well this did not happen as on Day 2, Room 19 was even worse, no phone working, no plugs to charge phone, was told to charge my phone in the bathroom, dirty dirty carpet and rusty bath ware I went back to reception,  complained and again told no rooms to change to and to come back the next day, so on Day 3 was given room 351 well you would have thought changing rooms twice it should have been third time lucky, well these hotel staff members had no respect for me, my adult daughter and two year old grandchild. This room was the better of the two by far but I really would not even put my dog to sleep in it. We roughed it that night as we were leaving the hotel on the fourth day at 6.40 a.m to get picked up via shuttle service. No member of staff at all was at reception in this so called 5 star hotel. I left the key on front desk and walked out and will never ever return not even if I was getting it for free. I WANT MY MONEY BACK THAT I PAID FOR THIS NO STAR HOTEL. RECEPTION STAFF RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL, ROOMS NOT FIT FOR ANY ANIMAL. TOTAL TOTAL SHAM OF A PALACE , WHY THEY CALL IT A PALACE NOBODY KNOWS. ANY GOOD REVIEWS ARE ALL LIES AND PICTURES WELLLLLL VERY VERY DECEIVING. I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THIS HOTEL IS NOT 5 STAR AND IM RATING IT 1 STAR ONLY ONLY ONLY. I was there from 25th May - 29th May so this most definitely is a recent review sitting in the comfort of my home to let you all know."

        "review_title": "TERRIBLE HOTEL DEFINITELY NOT 5*!!!",
        "review_text": "Food was decent,reception area was beautiful,some of the staff were nice  Rooms were extremely outdated.. we had to ask to move rooms twice. The third room still wasn't great but much better than the previous 2. The carpets in all 3 rooms smelt bad.. they need to put new carpets.smelt like someone had smoked in the room. There were holes in the carpet.. and after hoovering the carpet, it was still SO dirty -there was a staff called 'Ahmed' (kitchen staff). He was extremely rude. We asked for water 3 times in which on the last time he said 'if you wait a minute I said I am coming'.but we shouldn't have to ask 3 times for water,then on another day we put fruit on a table and went to get our mains. We came back to see that the fruit had gone and someone else had laid their stuff on the table. We asked Ahmed where our fruit had gone and who someone else's stuff was on our table? He said that the other people had asked him to reserve that table for them. It's a first come first serve basis in terms of the table and we already put our fruit there (INFRONT OF AHMED) so that table was supposed to be ours and why did ahmed not tell these our people the table is already taken When I asked ahmed for his name, he said 'why?' I replied 'why not?'He then said again 'but why do you want my name?' I than again responded with 'but why not' - finally he said 'Ahmed' which i am now wondering if that even is his name. He has black spikey up hair and he always looks moody/angry. We also saw him raising his voice to another kitchen staff. I'mshocked at his service. The cleaners (most of them) are really sweet. The reception staff - at one point we phoned them from our room (finally when we was in a room where the phone actually worked) and a female staff said one minute il call you back, which she never did. When we went downstairs and asked her about this, she said 'speak to my colleague' and asked her male colleague to deal with us. I explained this to the colleague and he was very rushed in his response but totally ignored what I was saying and just said 'well get an engineer to come'. It was because the tv signal was terrible.  Now, let's get to the engineer. This same engineer came to our previous room because our phone was not working. He looked like he was doing something then he said 'il be back 5 minutes'. Of course he didn't come back. Now when the engineer came to sort the tv out, I mentioned to him, 'oh you didn't come back in the other room to fix the phone?'. He laughed and said 'no, no it wasn't me'. Well it clearly was you as I am looking at you now and it was 100% the same person. Anyway, he said 'il be back' (for a second time) - I said 'please make sure you actually come back'. Do you think he did? NO. What a joke. By this point we were so fed up, we left it. Didn't even bother telling reception as they clearly have no interest in addressing situations. I would never go back to his hotel and I would never recommend it to anyone. It's DEFINITELY not 5*. It's just about 3*."

        "review_title": "Not Quite 5 Stars – Honest Review of El Mouradi Palace, Tunisia",
        "review_text": "We recently stayed at El Mouradi Palace for 10 days, and while there were a few highlights, overall, the experience did not live up to the 5-star rating advertised. I'd personally rate it closer to 3 stars, and that’s being generous.  Firstly, the hotel itself is very outdated. Built in 2005, it’s clear that the rooms are in urgent need of refurbishment. We had to change rooms three times due to poor conditions before finally settling in a fair one.  The outdoor facilities were another letdown. Both the pool and beach areas lack enough sunbeds for guests. Even if you're lucky enough to find one, many are broken or unusable. It’s frustrating to start your day with a scramble for decent seating.  Service around the pool was inconsistent. The bar is supposed to operate from 9:30am to 6pm, but on several occasions beer and slush ran out by 4pm. Instead of restocking, staff would simply stop serving and direct guests to the reception bar. Unfortunately, there you’ll often face long queues and are required to wear a shirt to be served – inconvenient when you’re coming straight from the pool.  As for dining, the buffet was underwhelming. Most dishes tasted very similar, with an overuse of the same spices and minimal variation between meals. Even pizza and fish options became repetitive, and there was a noticeable lack of grilled meats like steaks or ribs. After just three days, we were already tired of the food.  The à la carte restaurant experience was also disappointing. It's only available on select days and must be booked in advance. During our 10-day stay, we were only able to secure a reservation once. While the presentation was nice, the food tasted almost identical to the buffet offerings.  Despite these setbacks, we did encounter some excellent staff members who helped improve our stay. Special thanks to Abdul and Aziz from the buffet and Bairen at the reception – their professionalism and friendly service stood out and deserve recognition.  In summary, El Mouradi Palace has potential but currently falls short of a true 5-star experience. The value for money is reasonable, so if your expectations are adjusted accordingly, you might still enjoy your stay. That said, we won’t be returning, but don’t let that stop you from giving it a try – just come prepared to manage expectations, especially when it comes to comfort and dining."

        "review_title": "A great disappointment, despite a promising setting",
        "review_text": "I am deeply disappointed by the policy of this hotel, which in 2025 continues to distinguish between local guests, residents abroad and foreign (non-Arab) tourists. I came with my parents for a 3 night stay, followed by a second booking with friends. Upon arrival, the welcome was icy: no drink or smile. We were simply asked to fill out a form, present our ID and wait... a long time.  Then we were charged a tourist tax three times higher than normal (9 dinars/person/night instead of 3). After reporting this, received from another hotel to support it, the checkout person eventually corrected it – a mistake that can happen, of course, but leaves a bitter taste upon arrival.  Then we were given the keys and asked to come back at 2:30 pm for the bracelets, refusing access to lunch on the pretext that the first meal included is dinner. A surprising practice, because in all the hotels I have stayed in, even when the rooms are not ready, guests receive their bracelet immediately to enjoy the buffet.  Another unpleasant surprise: although my two reservations were made in \"all inclusive\", I am told that it is actually a \"soft\" formula. No mention of that on the voucher. Several inconsistent and contradictory justifications then follow:  You must stay at least 4 nights to have the true all inclusive.  Local customers are not entitled to this formula.  Only Tunisians living abroad can benefit (which is my case).  Finally, as I share the room with my parents, it is \"impossible\" to offer me a formula different from theirs.  For the second booking (two separate rooms) Even in a separate room, on the same booking, different formulas cannot be applied.  As a result, I paid almost twice as much for an \"all inclusive\" formula as the \"soft\", and finally received the latter – very limited. The limitation does not stop at alcoholic drinks, it does not give access to the restaurant/beach (snacks & barbecues), nor to the pool bar, and does not allow lunch on arrival.  In other words, if you are Tunisian (or Arab in general), you will most likely have access to a limited formula, regardless of which one you have booked.  Apart from that, the hotel is vast, with beautiful scenery, and the restaurant staff is very respectful and warm – a real positive. On the other hand, room 536 does not correspond to the standards of a 5 star: outdated furniture, fridge out of service, extremely dirty carpet.  However, I would like to thank the young woman in charge of customer relations, who sincerely tried to find a solution, without success. I have cancelled my second booking and will not set foot in this or any other hotel in the El Mouradi chain, which I strongly advise against anyone in a situation similar to mine."

But above all, what truly stood out was the dedication, warmth, and professionalism of the entire team. We want to sincerely thank Mr. Bayrem and Mr. Lotfi at the reception, Mrs. Hada from housekeeping, the restaurant team, and also the gentleman who helped us with our luggage at the hotel entrance – always helpful, friendly, and full of care.  Thank you for turning this stay into a beautiful, heartfelt memory.  We’ll definitely be back!"

The suites, even the classic ones, are spacious and luxurious. We only realized the Dar Doora connection when making arrangement for a day room before our midnight flight.  The rooftop restaurant serves an international menu during the day, which was a nice change during Ramadan. Breakfast was delicious.  The spa was a plus —free hammam access for guests, a relaxing massage (though not deep tissue), great facial and manicure.  Dar El Jeld is an easy choice for luxury; Dar Doora is a solid lower-cost option."

There are plenty of shops, restaurants and things to see all around this Hotel. The staff are pleasant and efficient. The rooms and bath are large and the bath floor is heated. The rooms are large and comfortable and they generously flood you with fruits and chocolates daily which made me feel at home and wanted.  Their spa was good but the hammam portion needs better handling and I was not happy since I was left to fend for myself and constantly had to call someone for assistance.  Food at their restaurant is delicious and the views from the rooftop are a splendid sight. They also a Tunisian restaurant with the same name next door and it is well rated and need a booking.  You cannot go wrong with this hotel !"

Room service food and restaurant meals were embarrassingly bad. Not a luxury place. Not up to international standards."

        "review_text": "The perfect boutique hotel. The spa is fabulous and far from overpriced. In fact, it is a steal. The negative reviews are absurd and unrealistic.   I did the hammam and 60 min massage for about $58 USD. The aestheticians were fabulous and I walked out feeling renewed. I only wish they had more availability. Book your appointments when you book your room, since it is fully booked. The spa has yummy treats. My only suggestion is that book early, since they run low on amazing local treats.  The hotel rooms are suites. We had a bedroom, living room, and 1.5 bathrooms for about $178 USD. The places is immaculate and beautifully decorated. Chocolates and fruit are given at turn down. I wish they switched it upon arrival.   The restaurants are divine. We ate on the roof which is casual and less than the restaurant where we ate last year. Try both, since it is a very different vibe.  Take the hotel transfer service. I usually don't, but taxis aren't allowed in the Medina and we found ourselves dragging our luggage. The premium for the transfer is worth it especially if arriving at night.  I highly recommend this property. My goal is to find more properties like this globally that deliver exceptional quality at a fair price."

Eventhough not in the hamman itself it was hot like hell. I mentioned several times to turn on the Ac and that heat harms me cause of my medical condition with multiple sclerosis but nothing and it was just me and my sister there at that time, so no risk someone else could \"freeze\". Viewing the price and honestly even for the tenth of the price an impudence rarely seen"

This might be true for the Hotel part. However this is far from being reality when it comes to the SPA. If one pays this prices for a SPA (675 Dinars for two people `100 euro each) in Tunisia one might think that you will be welcomed with at least a glass of water while you are in the waiting room which was not the case. You would also expect to be in the hands of highly professional beauty staff using good to high quality products, which unfortunately is not the case (manicure / nail polish was very poor). The girls are lovely but lack experience. All in all being at the spa was nice but value for money was far from being good. If you sell luxury clients need to get that!"

Of course if you speak French or Arabic would help a bit more.   - The animation team is absolutely the best. Every day there are so many activities and in the evening the entertainment and dancing. Loved the whole experience, and they are very helpful. Shouout to Manel and Maggie they are exceptional. Their dedication and sense of humour and dancing style made whole stay different."

Has been a fabulous break away from the UK in this family friendly hotel and even though our group was all adults we can't fault the hotel at all. Rooms are spacious and comfortable, facilities are spot on with a great pool with a swim up bar. A stones throw from the beach as well. All the staff have been so friendly and helpful from the waiting staff in the dining room, bar staff who keep you refreshed with a great selection of drinks on the all inclusive. Special mention to Oumymq who is part of the animation team who is an absolute diamond. She's been so helpful and friendly and it went a long way to making the stay so enjoyable. Kudos to the rest of the animation team as well, it's a tough job but the activities help break up the day.  Would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of coming to Tunisia and for an all inclusive break it can't be knocked."

All the staff do, but you obviously make bonds with certain ones quickly!  The animation guys are ace, didn't get all their names but Oumyma, mygi, and soleil were really friendly, helpful and fun! Pool is SOOO good, sun all day pretty much whenever your lounger is, beach a stones throw away.  Easy to get to from the airport. Only downside was the air con was broken apparently in the whole hotel for our stay, made it very warm at night in the room, but luckily could keep door open and the net curtain over. Didn't really change the heat, and definitely needs fixing asap!  Cleaners are all very lovely and rooms are clean.  The odd bit of maintenance needs doing in rooms/around the hotel with lighting, but over all a wonderful stay 💛💛"

From the moment we arrived, we were seduced by the enchanting setting of the hotel, nestled in the heart of a beautiful palm garden, with direct access to a dream beach.  The staff is simply exceptional: welcoming, professional and always ready to help with a smile. Many thanks to the whole team for their kindness throughout our stay.  The room was spacious, clean, well decorated, with very comfortable bedding. We particularly enjoyed the calm of the place, perfect to recharge.  The buffets are varied, well presented and delicious. There is something for everyone, and Tunisian specialties are a real treat. Breakfast is also very complete, with a wide choice of fresh products.  The pool is huge and very nice, and the thalassotherapy center is a real plus to relax and enjoy the stay to the fullest. The private beach is superb, with its fine sand and turquoise waters.  It was our first time at Djerba Plaza, and certainly not the last. We leave with memories full of head and only one desire: come back very quickly! And thank you again to Erwan for his warm welcome and always smile."

A big thank you to the following for making our holiday even more enjoyable: Hassan the lovely waiter at the pool bar Joe in the entertainment team Naseeb at the main hotel bar. They all go above and beyond to make sure you have the best holiday & constantly have your drinks replaced.  Overall I would definitely go back to this hotel - highly recommend.  The beach is lovely white sand but when the sea is choppy it’s quite dirty as me and my partner found out when getting on the jet ski’s and we’re filthy!"

The cook for our outings prepared sandwiches on request when it didn’t seem usual but he does it with good heart. The cuisine is local so spicy, but there is white pasta, thankfully! In addition the place is very clean and very secure. The housekeepers we were in the little care in our rooms every day while we did not tidy up too much ... There is an indoor heated pool and there is the outdoor pool protected from the wind thanks to the cypress and architecture. There might be some things to complain about, but considering the price and the kindness and attention we get, it’s worth 5. Just the soundproofing in the room requires balls."

        "review_text": "Hello, I have been a loyal customer of the Menara for almost three years, where I come regularly, about once a month, whether as a family or alone to rest. What makes me come back each time is the staff: whether it be the restaurant team, the bar, the entertainment or the housekeepers, all are very kind and respect the privacy of the customers.  It is true that the hotel still has a few areas for improvement, such as the elevator which sometimes has breakdowns, or a few minor malfunctions here and there. But I have complete confidence in Mrs Narjess, who places great importance on the well-being of customers and is doing everything necessary to make sure that everything goes in the right direction.  Mohamed, the manager, is always available and very attentive, which makes every stay more pleasant. I also had the pleasure of meeting Mr. AmanAllah, a new charismatic and motivated director, who seems determined to make Menara an institution of excellence.  What I also value very much is the quality of the customers. When I come with my children, I feel safe, which is essential for me, especially in Tunisia.  I would also like to highlight the warm atmosphere that emerges throughout the hotel, where every detail contributes to creating a soothing and friendly environment. A special crush for my little Nermine as well as for the entire animation team, always invested, caring and able to adapt to everyone’s desires. Thanks to them, we feel really good here!  Thanks to Djappa, who has been faithful to himself for the past three years, and to Rami and Hassen, who facilitate each stay. Jdidi is a great Mr! I would have sincerely liked to thank many other people, but space does not allow me.  I look forward to repeating the experience and discovering even more little touches that make all the difference."

        "review_title": "Nice hotel, but it's tired  and in need of some TLC,  outside and especially  in the Hammam",
        "review_text": "We booked this venue through Thomas Cook as we preferred to be very close to the beach and their online details showed a picture of  what appeared to be a nice venue overlooking lovely beach/sea views. But as it happened the beach was a long walk from the hotel and the  nice \"on-the-beach-venue \" wasn't there. However, when I queried it with the lady behind reception, she seemed to think that the \"pop-up\" beach venue was only there in the summer...Such a great shame !  The Hotel: It's a nice looking venue and first  impressions on entry was a definite \"wow\".. the little fountain area in the lobby is impressive and there was plenty of seating all around.  We received a friendly  welcome, and after the formalities we were given our room cards for our room on the second floor close to the lift as requested.  Bedroom and bathroom: The room was a little on the small side, but impeccably clean.  We needed to speak with reception about something, and luckily there was a phone on the bedside table... but dear readers, when, after pressing various buttons, the phone was just silent! So we moved the bedside  table to see if it was actually plugged in... and all we saw was a bundle of wires sticking out of the wall and NONE into the phone. 😂🤣... no wonder it wasn't working! So we went downstairs to mention it and the next thing we knew when we returned to our room, was that reception had sent up the maintenance guy who was only holding another phone in his hand, also without a lead ...which of course was of no use whatsoever... we showed him the wires hanging from the wall and I'm sure he must have understood as he seemed a little embarrassed by the whole silly situation!  Think Faulty Towers!  It was like a comedy sketch.... and we'd only just arrived!   What would be next 😅 The bed was comfortable and came with lumpy pillows - which actually surprisingly  enough were also comfy to sleep on.  Bathroom: Immaculately clean! No nasty fingermarks on the mirror, and we had the usual bathroom  condiments with lovely smelling shower gel and shampoo. There was a walk-in shower as opposed to a shower over a bath, which was great. It had good pressure and the water was always lovely and hot.. it was a  pure joy to stand under especially seeing that it was cold.. (still low season) but I didn't expect it to be that cool!  The lovely lady who made the bed and cleaned our room each day was a darling!  She said her name was Hazel (not sure if I heard  her right but it sounded like it..) not particularly Arabic but nevertheless we were able to communicate with each other. And extra special hugs with many \"Shukrans\" when she decorated our bed with flower petals... such a kind gesture and so so appreciated.   Restaurant: Plenty room all round with a help-yourself-style buffet for  breakfast, lunch and dinner. All the staff behind the buffet  and waiters were incredibly helpful and courteous. One tall helpful  lovely waiter in a white shirt, whose  name I have completely forgotten I'm ashamed to say, decorated our table with gorgeous hibiscus flowers and bougainvillea  flower petals. Again many  appreciated Shukrans all round.  Wines: (🙀) We ordered a bottle of red wine with dinner the first night which we didn't expect to be super good,  but I have to admit that is was really nice and a lovely surprise - so much so that we ordered another bottle of the same  quality the following night  (the only choices were red, white or rose)   On another night the waiter came back with a clear glass bottle the contents of which looked  more like rose rather than deep red, and when we tried it it tasted like vinegar, it was truly awful. Not even remotely palatable, so it got sent back and subsequently replaced with a bottle exactly the same, which was also immediately sent back after tasting.    We then asked if they had a bottle of what we had before we were told that this was all they had.. The ONLY red wine was the old vinegar tasting stuff..  So, the next available option was to go for a bottle of rose, which when it arrived had a darkish peachy  colour and tasted quite nice also.  So far so good, or so we thought.  The  following night we asked for the same rose, but his  time  the colour was very pale, and in our opinion it very much tasted like it had been watered down..  Anyway.. this pale coloured  non tasting liquid was, needless to say, also returned to where it came from.. and what they did with it behind the bar is anyone's guess...However,  it was subsequently  replaced with another bottle of the same label which luckily tasted  completely different and more like the wine of the previous night - it also had a much better colour.    So! Sadly to say... not  great on the wine front.. seemed like they just wanted to get rid of some old wine that had been lying  around to their all inclusive  European clients.. Impressed??   Hammam: In need of intense refurbishment, the toilet was broken in that it didn't flush, the inside of the steam room had black mould on the walls and ceilings with paint flaking off.  The sauna with broken slats of wood on the floor. I have to say that the mould  worried me.. hoping that I wouldn't become ill  Nala was lovely, she is clearly good at her job and we both enjoyed our pamper time - just such a shame the place was so run down.  Day trips: Instead of going on a so-called organised activity trip (as hawked on an irritatingly daily basis  by a person who has  great difficulty in understanding what \"No thank you\" means )  you can have your own driver who will take you wherever you want, which is what we did His name is; Chaaben khedira Gerant  he's on FB and is a pleasant helpful guy and speaks good English   Negative  bits: Outside by the pool/conference room area towards the entrance to the indoor pool and hammam, there are so many places that need to be deep cleaned, maintained, painted and refurbished, some of the sun beds need to be renewed as they were broken, and all of them can do with a good scrub. Basically attention to detail is needed   Changing currency: Beware!! We were advised on the bus that if anyone needed to change money  to do so at a bank. However, on the day we arrived we were given a lift  into to town by a member of the hotel staff,  as we needed to find a bank to get some cash to buy some supplies (he actually very kindly paid for our little bit of shopping)  and said that they could help with us with Dinars at reception.. Cut a long story short, we did exchange some Euros to Dinars  with the lady at reception but when it came to changing our remaining  Dinars back to Euros on the day of our departure, it seemed all of a sudden not to be at all possible  for some reason only known to her.  It would have been a simple exchange, nothing difficult about it but the lady at reception  whose name begins with H was adamant and totally refused to help. Instead she assured us that our Dinars could be changed at the airport on presentation of a passport. When I mentioned about needing an official receipt - she said that this wasn't the case, but that showing a passport would suffice. WRONG!! End of story - at the aiport the  currency exchange refused any dealings  So the Dinars were spent in the touristy shop a few feet away ..what an excellent place to have a shop!!. ❗️So readers, please beware!!  change money ONLY at a bank and obtain a receipt which you WILL need if you need to change Dinars back to your own currency!!  Would we come back to MENARA Hotel on a future occasion? No, I don't think so, although we enjoyed our little break and a change of scenery there are other places to explore. But a big thank you to all restaurant and buffet staff especially  Karima,   Didi behind the bar and \"Hazel\" the lady who cleaned our room ."

        "review_text": "Exceptional experience. The hotel has covered every possible aspect of hospitality on a family holiday (within their reasonable control).   Food? Superb Drinks? Flowing Facilities? Polished  Staff? Friendly, multilingual, always ready to help. The Animation/Entertainment staff in particular  are friendly and engaging, but never pushy. Every single member of staff we interacted with was at pains to make sure our son (5) was looked after, and having fun  Are there down sides? Yes.  Are they within the control of the hotel? No.   Insect bites are a pain, plastic in the sea and debris on the beach isn't ideal. But the staff are out on the beach every morning clearing and cleaning and making it as enjoyable as possible for everyone. Other reviews have dubbed the food as boring, or repetitive, or not hot enough, but ultimately this is the nature of buffet dining for a diverse multinational audience of vastly varying ages.   But there is nothing that can be expected of the hotel to change these very minor issues.   Further massive credit to the team of lifeguards. Attentive, engaged, and always working to look after the countless children on the water slides. Our 5yo tripped and grazed his knee and Emile carried him down 2 flights of stairs, insisted on disinfecting his leg and applying plasters, and wouldn't let him go until he was sure he was safe, happy again, and had a parent to hand."

        "review_text": "I had such a wonderful time at this hotel – everything was spot on from start to finish. The facilities were great, the food had plenty of variety, and the staff across the board were warm and professional.  What really stood out to me, though, was the entertainment team – they truly made the trip special. There was always something fun happening, and they put so much energy into keeping guests entertained. A big mention has to go to Zizo, who was simply outstanding! He has an amazing way of connecting with everyone and making sure people are having a great time. His energy is infectious and he brings so much personality to every activity and show.  Can’t thank the entertainment crew enough – they made it a trip to remember. I’ll definitely be recommending this place to friends and family!"

        "review_text": "We Loved Our Stay! Read Below for Our Honest Review  First of all, we truly loved and enjoyed our holiday at this hotel. We stayed on an all-inclusive basis and would definitely recommend giving this place a try especially if you’ve come across some of the more negative reviews. Here's our genuine take on the experience:  Key Highlights 1. Outstanding Staff The staff made our stay extra special! A huge shoutout to: AG, Makvew, Sai, Danni (Entertainment Team) Azhar, Kh. Ahmed, Lacrin (Chef), and Sarra (Receptionist)  They were all incredibly friendly, helpful, and consistently went out of their way to check in with us. Their warmth and effort made our trip truly memorable.  2. Delicious Food The food was fantastic with an impressive variety. Stations included: Fresh fish and meat Tunisian and Indian cuisine Kid-friendly options Occasional treats like sushi and fresh crab  For dessert lovers, there were plenty of sweet options including ice cream and various desserts. Drinks included white, red, and rosé wine, as well as beer with meals. The cocktails were amazing—especially the piña coladas. There’s a great cocktail menu and we’d recommend trying as many as you can!  3. Entertainment for All Ages The entertainment team worked hard and were full of energy. Activities were available for both kids and adults, and everyone was encouraged to get involved. They truly helped make the holiday fun and engaging.  Other Enjoyable Aspects Beautiful beachfront location  Spa services downstairs we enjoyed a massage and pedicure, which were great!  A Few Areas for Improvement Location: The hotel is quite far from the airport (around a two-hour drive), and there aren’t any shops nearby. We recommend the hotel consider offering a free shuttle bus to the nearest town, as we had to take a taxi to Tunis for essentials.  Room Cleanliness & Amenities:  Rooms are a bit outdated and could use a deep clean, especially the walls and picture frames.  Our room had only one glass for the entire 7-night stay.  There was  tea, coffee, but no sugar and milk provided in the room.  Housekeeping only made the bed and mopped the floor, no change of bed sheets during our stay. This is definitely an area that could be improved.  Final Thoughts Despite a few minor issues, we had a wonderful experience and would absolutely recommend this hotel. We’d love to return in the future!"

Yet more attention to detail is  needed in the rooms  cleaning wasn't up standards you had glass on desk and  mirrors that always looked smeared. Fabric furniture thought out the hotel needs updating had lots of makes. Noise in the hotel at night with children I know it's family hotel yet when you make a complaint management don't take seriously there is no actual action taken they don't care. In fact one day on beach they walked around spoke to guests and not once spoke to there own staff 😑 yet the entertainment team fantastic 👏🏾 👍🏾. Food was great service was on point. Cocktails was very watered down you had ask for more alcohol 🍸 😉 Please interduce pot for cups of tea not these cups that can't even make decent cuppa tea and real English Tea bags please. In corridors there are no security cameras only by lifts hotel didn't find that an issue."

        "review_text": "Just returned from a week at the hotel. We had a junior suite / the room was massive ( too big really and some wasted space) it had a sea view, but you also had a view of the roof. The bed was not comfortable it was hard, however I asked at reception if they could do something and they did put a topper in it, which was better. The hotel is plush in places, but some renovations are required. I saw some areas where there was damage, but tbh this didn’t impact in my stay. The restaurant was good, the food was really nice and I’ve read on other reviews that it was repetitive / this is a buffet, they are always the same, there was plenty to choose ( grilled meat/ fish/ Tunisian cuisine/ Indian/ pasta / pizza / fresh salad / and various desserts. The food was lovely. They have 3 themed restaurants- these are quite basic, and tbh could be improved.  The Italian for example- a set menu with two main courses ( who wants that)  Have a choice and add a salad and garlic bread! We didn’t go to the other themed restaurants as the menu was limited. The staff are the best asset to this hotel, All were attentive and couldn’t do more for you, especially Yassine in the restaurant and Mohamed in the bar. The beach is lovely but again they should clear the seaweed early or late on the day, no one wants to dodge the JCB walking along the beach.   The beach staff were excellent as well, the animation staff were jolly and they did interrupt your dinner, but I didn’t mind this they are drumming up support for the 9.30 show. I didn’t really like the dancing that they did but some people really enjoyed it - do it wasn’t for me but that’s fine. I would recommend it was a lovely week away."

        "review_text": "From the moment we arrived we were very very well looked after. All the staff literally always had a smile on their faces and nothing, and I mean nothing was too much trouble for any of them. My friend has never done all inclusive before and the choice alone at the bar overwhelmed her a bit so the gorgeous barman made her a special and unique cocktail which was called Gills cocktail and that is what she asked for each time she wanted it and it was made the same everytime.   The food was exquisite,  no cross contamination to  be seen, beautifully presented, a great choice and literally something for all tastes.   The pool was lovely with plenty of loungers and parasols. The water was a little chilly but I guess that is because it is the  beginning of the season and it hasn't had enough sun to heat it up yet. There is a great poolside service and if you are that way inclined, you could literally park yourself in the morning and not move again till the sun went down.  Rooms - we had the standard room but it was perfectly adequate, the shower was good, air con effective I did have a really loud buzzing noise coming out of my wardrobe. I brought it to housekeeping attention and it was delbt with immediately. Housekeeping themselves were totally brilliant and our rooms were kept in tip top condition.    Entertainment - i have never really  been one for the evening entertainment  but my travel companion pursued me to go all but one night and I have to say I really enjoyed every night. Dancing and generally losing your inhibitions a bit, and nobody cares cause we are all on holiday and having a blast. The entertainment team work damn hard all day and all evening sometimes I wander how they stay awake and so energetic  with the ridiculous long hours they work.   So 8 nights gone in a flash of utter joy and happiness. I cannot recommend this hotel enough and will be talking about it and the fabulous staff for a while to come. I already miss them and I hope to return to see them all again in the not too distant future.  Bravo - Absolutely fantastic xx"

        "review_title": "Dishonest Management 👎🏼",
        "review_text": "The management of this hotel is completely dishonest. Since returning home from our holiday I've received a response from my travel provider stating that the hotel has claimed I am lying and never made a formal complaint about the constant, excessive banging from the neighbors’ children next to us—every single night until 3am during our holiday. That accusation is disgusting.  I have screenshots of my conversations on WhatsApp and Facebook with staff at the hotel. So for anyone to claim that no complaint was made, or worse, that I fabricated the issue, is outright false and shameful.  Let me be clear: the general staff (entertainment team, waiters bar staff etc) at the hotel were lovely and the only reason this resort gets nice reviews!   But the management? Awful.  They refuse to acknowledge complaints, let alone resolve them. They need to take responsibility instead of brushing things under the carpet.  Also, if you're considering staying here—be prepared to put up with kids banging on the walls until 3am. When we went to reception for help, especially the male staff, their response was, “What do you want us to do? They’re kids.”  I understand they are children but there's no reason for them to be banging on the walls at all hours, and being on holiday isn’t an excuse for them to behave like brats, or for parents to completely stop parenting. At the same time I was at reception there was another couple who had come down to complaint about the same issue in a different area of the building so it appears this resort attracts a lot of parents that can't parent."

        "review_text": "The hotel was a nice hotel, clean and looks very like the pictures. There were a few down falls to it. 1.The buffet restaurant was average, it felt like it was really repetitive 2. The themed restaurant (Italian) menu was a set menu no choices but the wait times were ridiculous for simple food. We waited 30 mins from having our starter which was only tomato and mozzarella to geting our main course we had to ask where it was. They then skipped one of the courses for us. 3. The drinks on the first day were great proper cocktails, they then changed to pre made mixes which just tastes like water 4. The anamation team were very annoying, they would come to you while you were eating dinner and interrupt your meal to get to come to the entertainment nights. They also kept making the same comments to my partner about him being muscle and tall. It got annoying for him because it was every day the same people.  We did make a complaint at the hotel regarding the drinks and restaurant and they upgraded us to a prestige room. There wasn't anything really prestige about it it was the same as our first room just had a smart tv. The prestige bar area you get access to isn't very special either. Jaccuzi that don't work and seemed quite dirty when in it.  Overall the holiday was OK but the hotel definitely needs to take some things into consideration.  Also a beef burger was served to me with no beef it was only a slice of salami on it.  I would return however I would hope some of the points I've made would be taken into consideration"

        "review_text": "The quality of customer service is outstanding. All the employees whether it be: baggage handler, reception, housekeepers, bar and buffet staff really all are constantly at the small care it is really remarkable and most pleasant. The service around the pool or by the beach is a big plus especially with children. The friendly animation team beautiful energy. Our daughter had a blast at the mini disco and the color party. The staff at this hotel really love their jobs and do it wonderfully! Thank you all very much.  The buffet is amazing every day different dishes there is really something for everyone. Breakfast is fabulous fresh juice pressed before our eyes nothing like to start a beautiful day at this hotel.   Just a shame the indoor pool is not heated.  The room we had a garden view, the staff planted new trees all week and it's a good thing because it was a bit empty. Great bedding! Tv French chains mini bar well supplied for small and large. The bathroom is spacious just a lot of humidity which leaves room for a little mold and finishes leave a little to be desired but considering the time spent in this room it is not much. A big bravo to this army of people who make this hotel such a warm and welcoming place because considering the surface it is quite a job.  The hotel beach is really next door it is very clean it is well maintained and well guarded. For children there is everything you need beautiful outdoor structures as an interior in case of bad weather. The staff speaks French perfectly well. Great stay I can only highly recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is absolutely lovely however because it went viral on TikTok, you have a lot of silly little girls walking around half naked filming content ! I wouldn’t say it’s a five star hotel however is still very nice . The food was repetitive, but I find that in all inclusive. Do not fall for the waiters sop story especially the one at the beach bar about how much they earn I fell for it the first day and then realised exactly what they was doing. I watched them for a few days and see how many tips they got. I found that the waiting staff a bit poncey lingering about  waiting for a tip also if they get a tip in any other currency, they will pester you to change it up to their currency for them. Also, the men on the beach selling stuff pester you to buy things don’t bother just go into town it’s a fraction of the price.  There is one member of staff that stood out for me. He was so lovely and that’s Mounir at reception. Bell boy I think absolutely lovely made you feel welcome and always had a smile on his face.  What I didn’t like was the cleaning supervisor knocking on your door every night to ask you if everything was okay to me again I think this was done in order to get tips. I understand their pay isn’t great but I do feel that you are pressured into giving tips, not all the staff like that, but majority of them are. They only serve about free cocktails which are absolutely disgusting. It’s got to be the worst mojito I’ve ever had. It’s basically lime juice.  The nurse downstairs in spa I told her I needed some antihistamine. She was already in  the city when I spoke to her on the telephone she bought me back exactly the same cream I had bought from the shop in the hotel and then proceeded to to tell me I had to pay her Cab fair ! you was already there before coming to work and you’re making me pay for your ride to work !   À la carte restaurant don’t bother booking it’s the same food from the buffet but they just serve it to you. We went we was a family of 4 with 2 vegetarians. Their main course was couscous and half of boiled egg !  It wasn’t very nice and not one of us finished anyone of our courses.  The hotel grounds are very clean and the pool area is lovely."

The food was delicious and a great variety, with some of your usual (chips, pizza...), lots of fresh fruit and veg, freshly made pasta, handmade deserts and pastries, and lots of lovely local dishes to try. There is also a Tunisian restaurant that is really nice, and it was great trying the local food.  There are nice pools, a lovely and clean beach, and plenty of sun loungers. There is a watersports shop on the beach where you can do activities for an additional cost, which was well priced.   Overall, this was a great place, and the staff made it that extra bit special and truly enjoyable. Definitely worth the visit."

The food was good, a bit repetitive towards the end but there’s always something for everyone. I would recommend when you come into the food hall to sit on the left side as soon as you walk in the door and give the waiter Yassin (I hope that’s spelt correctly) some love! He deserves it as he was very accommodating to me and my partner from the first day and was just so sweet, he’d see us walk in before we would even see him and by the time we would get to our table he would remember the drinks we’d usually order and have them ready for us , small things like this mean a lot !! We made sure he got tipped before we left as hard work like that shouldn’t be unnoticed! One issue we did face was ants in our room, there would be swarms of them outside the bathroom always and I’m not sure how that issue can be solved but it wasn’t pleasant finding them on me in bed !"

Moreover the ventilation was super noisy not to mention the air conditioning ... we went to the reception and the next day we changed rooms! ouff I confess that our stay would have been ruined if we had been left in this room 551 and especially with respect to the price  So here we had the 554 which is just perfect from every point of view!  The buffet is very varied and very good!  We highly recommend this hotel!"

Pool is very spacious and pool area is constantly clean by always smiling and very helpful lady Maha. Barr staff are excellent and will bring you drinks to your lounger. Massive thank you to Isam who was brilliant and took very good care of us. Rooms are spacious and cleaned daily. The restaurant has a large variety of food every meal time. Food was delicious and staff were brilliant and very attentive. FANTASTIC ANIMATION TEAM - Mogli, Smiley, Mino, Heidi (dont remember all names).Every day was different,  full of games and laugh. Great activities during the day (aqua aerobic, archery, darts, mini golf) and night (bingo, karaoke, theme nights). I was not bored for a second. Animation team were fantastic.  They are working so hard for so many hours to make the experience worth while. Staff will go above and beyond to make every guest's stay unforgettable. The only minus I found during our stay is lack of staff in reception. There is only one person working there so if you have any query to be resolved, awaiting time is quite long."

His energy, charisma, and sense of humor made every day more enjoyable. From poolside activities to the fun and vibrant evening shows, Panda and the whole team created such a welcoming and exciting atmosphere. There was always something to do, whether you wanted to join in games, dance, or just enjoy the show. The entertainment was not only professional but also very personal , Panda made a real effort to connect with guests and make sure everyone was having a good time. He truly made my vacation memorable! If you’re staying here, don’t miss the chance to experience the entertainment  it adds so much to the overall vibe. Thank you, Panda and team!"

        "review_text": "We visited this hotel for 11 nights. I can honestly say it was one of the most beautiful grounds we have seen, very well taken care of and very clean.  Food was as expected for an all inclusive and they had a great range of tunisian food which was great to try.  The rooms are pretty standard from what you would expect, plenty of space for my family (2 adults and a toddler). Rooms were cleaned whenever we needed and the cleaners were absolutely lovely and great at their job, you can tell they took pride in what they did. Sheets and towels were replaced when needed.  There is a shop in the hotel and also some shops within a 15 min walk if you needed anything. The pool was large and spacious, with plenty of sun loungers and parasols, this is the same as the beach. Pool area was cleaned constantly so was very clean. Just be aware the pool can be very slippy. The pool had a great design where it was super shallow for the little children to be able to paddle safely but had a good depth on the opposite end.  The bar by the pool was great and again staff were amazing, I think we only had to get our own drink once or twice as there was this lovely barman with his sombrero that would frequently check if we needed another and would bring one over if we did.   Staff were honestly out of this world, every single member of staff went the extra mile especially when it came to our 2 year old son, they all made the effort to play with him and chat which he loved. Animation team were great, panda was fab and so was malik (unsure if I'm spelling correctly sorry).  Reception staff were helpful when needed and every single member of staff we came across had the biggest smiles on their faces and always made is feel so welcome. The staff in the restaurant were great, we would get seated and offered drinks all with smiles on faces.  One member of staff in particular was absolutely amazing in the restaurant which was Med. I can honestly say I think he made our 2 year olds holiday, he was kind, caring and so so helpful. Our son Freddie would squeal with excitement whenever he would see Med and run up to him every chance he got. Med is fantastic at his job and really made our holiday that bit more special.   Our only issue was our room door broke but this was fixed within an hour and a half so didn't put any dampener on our holiday. Overall we had the best holiday and so much of that is because of the staff there. We will definitely come back, thank you to all staff 🙏"

        "review_text": "If you want to enjoy your holiday don’t book this place. From the check in it was bad. The reservations manager ruined the stay from the start, so rude and unaccountable when booking wasn’t found that he confirmed that He made. Instead he was laughing behind the receptionist who was clearly in distress that she couldn’t find the booking.  Rude racist staff that ruin whole experience. Very accommodating for Caucasian guests and you can see that. Scowl when asking for water or glasses for the water which they stomp down on table. It’s almost like anything is too great of an ask. Wait around 20 mins for refill of cups or food at buffet. Ramzi and Ahmad were so rude and disrespectful to my family in the restaurant that managers had to intervene but even then they stand around bitching and complaining right in front of you. Pictures are incredibly misleading and the rooms do not look like images shown. Rooms are barely cleaned and towels look like they are flunged into rails. They don’t wipe or clean anything nor make the beds- nor change the sheets or glasses. On check out they don’t even ask how was your stay maybe because they already know it was a bad experience.   Things they don’t tell you:   No kettles included in rooms- need to pay 5Dinars per day therefore no cutlery or cups in room and if you ask the bar they will not give you any.   Iron- can rent for 1 hour when you pay a deposit like 40 dinars which they do give back allegedly   They do not provide towels for the pool or beach   Air con does not work till June so bear that in mind as you will also be dying of heat in the room  Only nice thing is grounds of hotel. Food is poor, no customer service and rooms don’t get cleaned. Beach is very dirty- red flag beach so can’t swim in it. AVOID"

        "review_text": "Got back on Sunday from a weeks stay, hotel itself was nice, pool big and kids slides were open a couple of the times we walked round but they arent the best little one kept getting stuck on one of them as there wasnt enough water to push him down and got a bit of a mark on him from getting stuck, he loved the big pool so we just stared there. Signs all over to say no saving sunbeds but of course people did so it was a bit annoying!!   animation team were great - always trying to get people involved and were brilliant with kids. Kids disco every night at around 2030 was okay just very repetitive songs but i suppose thats standard. Then had a show on after at 2130 which varied from like bingo to dance shows etc  food was meh, there is something for everyone i think but i lived off spaghetti and chips and a bit of salad all week - probably took more precaution as I am pregnant so didnt want to go too far into the unknown lol... KFC around the corner lol   there's a fridge in the room which is handy as we used it to keep bottles of water etc in there - no dilute or anything for kids and fruit juice very limited so went to the shop and got our little one some from there and just kept it in the fridge and took his water bottle so he always had something to drink. I didn't have alcohol as pregnant so cant advise on that but hubs had the larger and said it was crap as tasted watered down.  no air con until 1st June so room was an absolute sweat box, especially first few days as reached 34 degrees which was just ridiculous!   left the hotel a couple of times and got harassed constantly and nearly kidnapped by a taxi driver when we asked to go into Sousse centre so then avoided going out from then on... There is also a shop at the hotel which sold pretty much everything from floaties for the pool to suncream, clothes, and gifts and snacks.  hotel staff themselves were lovely and polite, constantly saw the cleaners going round and cleaning up - no issues with our room, beds made every day with fresh towels.   Transfer time from Airport to hotel was about 40 mins so not bad. Went with EasyJet however didn't see one rep there once which is a bit of a shame as any issues there was no one to really help with any situations."

        "review_text": "Many have already written it, the plant is already in need of renovation.  When I arrived, the wind raged outside, whipping against the glass door to the balcony. This caused a periodic squeaking noise. I was afraid it would drag on all night and rob me of sleep. That's why I asked for a repair. Repair? Misrepresentation! The mechanic was in the room, entered it alone and left it open.  Cleanliness I can say almost nothing. Except for the shared toilet next to the restaurant. It was underwater a few days ago. The urine stones used there are also too many and too extreme. I also didn't say anything about the water after I already got such an impression regarding the balcony window/door. By the way, this is also totally difficult to move. Something like the whole body effort is necessary for this.  Gym, which is also super small and already drained costs 30Dinar or 25Dinar if you look at the price list (probably this is outdated). That's about 3.30EUR per day. For such a price you can get a Mega Fitness Studio including sauna in Germany.  In the restaurant, I thought it was a shame that the fruits had only the choice between: Honeymelon, apple, strawberry, orange for a week. Oranges are great compared to the Germany Quali. No acidity at all just sweetness, as it should be. Apples let me down. The first one obviously tasted rotten and looked like this. I have already chosen the second one much more consciously, but nevertheless it had a somewhat rotten taste. Then I left it completely. Desserts were great. One day they even decorated the desserts with some gold leaf. Wooow :D Sheep meat was great, fish delicious even the seafood dishes. Potatoes were somehow always cold and a bit badly dried. So on the whole I am very satisfied with the food except for the variety of fruits (grapes would be good for example). Plate, cutlery you unfortunately had to look for again and again. I felt like they only use one set of plates and it has to rotate and be flushed in time otherwise there is not enough.  I thought it was surprising that you have to pay for gym. Equally astonishingly, leave a deposit of 30dinars for the beach towel.  I was in the saunas. It's two rooms. In both you get the feeling that the wall could fall off to lean back according to the picture, if you look at the ceiling and see that it is already loose.  To the beach there is a gate with security. And the bathing loungers are free. I prefer to lie in the sand but then in the end there were too many critters, mosquitoes pipapo.  Otherwise a nice facility that would do a repainting good. But my next hotel will be one with free FitnesRoom and a larger selection of fruits."

        "review_text": "As I wrote for the other reviews, the real discovery was the beauty of Tunisia, both for the places and for the kindness and helpfulness of the natives. The Resort is very nice, a true 5 star all inclusive and boasts 3 swimming pools directly on the sea, 3 bars, various restaurant rooms and a beautiful SPA. Deck chairs and umbrellas are your choice and even if you go a little later you will always find a seat, maybe not right in the front row, and in case you need the lifeguards are very happy to help you find a seat. The food for us Italians, apart from the delicious and varied breakfast, is not really the top, as the is too spicy and repetitive. A special mention goes to the cooking of veal and grilled fish. The pasta is badly cooked. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with international TV and very efficient mini bar, with two bathrooms each. We for personal reasons had it changed and in less than an hour we were given a new room. The staff is always friendly and willing to help, several times we had taxis called to go downtown... But the real gem is the Spa, we spent a magnificent afternoon, the relaxing massage of one hour was wonderful.  One thing to emphasize is the care for the customer: On the evening of my birthday they made me find a delicious cake with a lot of surprise. Thank you."

The indisputable black spot is breakfast where the welcome is execrable, the waiters turn their heads not to respond to your requests, the management waits with arms crossed....and at 10am very precise we put you squarely out, everything is dismantled.  This picture ruins everything else. Too bad."

        "review_text": "Wow where do I start, the first hotel room we were allocated didn’t have a door handle and when I lent over the balcony wall I was covered in white paint, new clothes, no wet sign. We were moved to different room, the safe was broken but thought we would just hide valuables or take them with us.   The pool area is really nice and the staff are happy to help and there is a nice atmosphere there, snacks aren’t too bad there either. Probably the best part of the holiday.   The food/ buffet area is terrible on the 3rd day I suffered from food poisoning from uncooked chicken.   My son ended up with a black eye from the water park because a piece of apparatus was broken, no sign or tape, nothing to say is was broken. The staff did apologise but there was no first aid or accident book. ( I put ice on it myself to reduce the swelling)   I kept noticing my hotel room smelt like smoke then we came back to it after a day at the pool, we were gone from 8am- 4pm each day we were here. Then on the 4th day I noticed a packet of cigarettes had been taken from an unopened pack of 200 which I was taken home for a friend so I moved these into my suitcase, the 5th day I was packing my suitcase and I noticed another packet had gone. So the cleaner must have a thing for menthol cigarettes.   Overall please don’t go here."

        "review_text": "We have not long got back from our holiday in Tunisia. We all spent a week at the Mahdia Beach & Aqua Park, and we found all staff at the hotel to be very friendly, from the cleaners to the animation team. The animation team need some praise as they really go out there way to make you feel welcome, learn all guests' names, and get you involved in all activities.   The hotel is very beautiful inside and kept very clean. The atmosphere by the pool was very relaxing, and the dj set was very good. Nobody was fighting over sunbeds. There was plenty for everybody. We really enjoyed the food near the pool area. The omlettes, fresh orange juice,kebabs, chips, tuna roll, crepes, and donuts were all very nice. The restaurant itself was a buffet style and it was up and down, some nights we got tired of the same thing and some things such as rice and potatoes wasn't cooked as to how we would of liked. The paella was delicious and the cakes. We really enjoyed the cocktails inside the hotel itself, and some of the liquors were nice. We did go out of the hotel some nights to eat. We really liked 'Roys' the food and drinks were lovely.   The evening entertainment at the hotel was good, it was something different each night. We liked the light show and Mj show.   The trips we went on were very good. We did quad biking, a visit to the colosseum, and we went on a pirate ship.   The hotel has its own private beach. It has the most beautiful sand. There are lots of sunbeds which are not at any extra cost. We felt very safe as there were a lot of security around the hotel and on the beach.  Our room was cleaned everyday and we really liked the walk in shower. The beds were comfortable and we had a balcony that we sat on some evenings before bed to relax.   The inside pool was lovely and we all enjoyed the water park, lots of fun!  Thank you to all staff at the hotel for a pleasant stay."

Room below standard, phones across whole hotel apparently do not work so could not call reception. Balcony doors do not shut or lock  properly, mini fridge on floor rather than in the built in unit it should be. No air con.  Reception very very rude and no respect for women at all.  Awful start….

I travelled with my mum and my two little girls and we loved everything! There is so much food to choose from (but I am a massive foodie and not fussy) and it is available all day. My girls loved being able to get food that they liked all day. Aqua park is just the right size for little people, without you losing them or running around looking where they are. Room was clean and towels changed daily (not a single cockroach was noted during our 10 day stay) Now let me focus on the service we received. ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE who works at that hotel was AMAZING! They work long hours and deal with a variety of clients and yet are always smiling, always polite, always willing to help. All waiters couldn't do enough for us, all life guards are alert and on point (I witnessed one life guard save a little toddler from drowning and his speed was out of this world!!), the animation team are brilliant! I must give an absolute special mention to Mimi and Ranyme, these girls are diamonds! Their work at kids club and kids disco left some special memories for my girls to treasure. They even let my ladies be their assistants on stage on our last night there. The beach was clean and beautiful! My family will be back to Mahdia Beach and I hope to see some of the amazing people who work there again!"

Little dedication to Rio, slim chaidi , Fernando, Willy and all the others.  Regarding the equipment and the environment, the pools are clean beautiful , a little cool the first days but it is normal we are only at the beginning of the season. The beach is beautiful, merchants are shipped by security to ensure the tranquility of holidaymakers. The rooms we had lack a little refreshing... The bathtub leaks, has trouble draining water, the beds were not made every day...   Small flat on the aquapark, it is outside the hotel, drinks and food are paid despite the all inclusive formula... Otherwise it is more than enough.  About the food, we ate well. Snack open from 10:18 am , pancake donuts all day. There is not a huge choice but the taste is present 😋   Second downside for the ambient noise especially in the evening, some holidaymakers abuse a little too much of the all inclusive and become disturbing for those who just want to spend a quiet evening with their children without hearing howling at the end of fields. A little more intervention by the security service would be desirable.  I think I summarized a good part of the stay and the hotel 🙃"

The transfer from the airport was over four hours landed at 10pm but not arriving to the hotel till gone 3am and on arrival I was given the most awful room with dirty mouldy mattress and bedframes yellow stained bedding and mouldy air conditioning I was made to sleep on that till they decided to change my room the next day little bit better except there no air conditioning in 30 degrees heat so it's impossible to get a good night sleep that a with the noise of drunken loud inconsiderate guests nearby . The hotel its self is located close to a beautiful sandy beach and it has security which is really good as you will get hustle to buy stuff whilst your relaxing on the beach they is loads of options of watersports which is really good and the hotel.also provided activity round the pool all through out the day some the music played round the pool is very inappropriate for younger people and can be very loud but I get there are trying to entertain the older person the animation team have good energy and are fun but not all of the hem are friendly and the only one who made an effort was slim shady he made my little laugh ,the hotel has some really good facilities one being a big water park on downfall is your not allowed no food or drink not even water they have a cafe bar but extra cost shouldn't have to pay when all-inclusive but I think this is also maybe as they have people f om outside visit and maybe they trying to offer option for them but it's optional you don't have to buy from there but just means you have to leave to go back to lunch etc the staff have been very unhelpful for us and I see that this is different story for other people and they have different experiences but for me I've had to get my own cutlery at food times and always seem to get the staff that are not so happy and yes I did try to tip them but in my opinion this shouldn't make them treat anyone different the hotel does have some nice parts we have enjoyed the swimming pool and the nature seeing all the beautiful butterflies,lizard and birds and seeing the gardening working hard cutting the palm 🌴 trees down in hot heat as well as seeing the maintenance man painting I can see they are trying to improve this hotel but I really do think that you should focus on better food and more hygienic restaurants and dining area I feel that allowing guests to leave plate everywhere in courage more flies and you also have now got coaches I've seen another post commented even though there has been alot of negative we have had some great moments and me and my little have experience new things like enjoying a camel ride so we have something good to take away from this holiday personally I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone."

It’s one of the best places in Tunisia for families looking to balance relaxation, kid-friendly fun, and good food.  🏖️ Location & Atmosphere:  The resort is set right on a beautiful stretch of Mahdia beach, known for its clean turquoise water and soft white sand. The beachfront is spacious and not overcrowded, even during peak hours, and the water is shallow and safe for children. The whole property is kept clean and well-maintained, with lush gardens, palm trees, and wide walking paths.  💦 Aqua Park & Kids’ Fun:  The Rayar Aqua Park inside the resort is definitely a highlight. There are multiple water slides and splash zones — perfect for children of all ages. Our kids spent hours going back and forth between the mini water slides and the larger ones. There’s also a Kids Club with supervised activities, crafts, and games There are multiple restaurants and snack bars on-site. The buffet was varied and fresh — offering both local Tunisian specialties (like couscous, brik, mechouia salad) and international dishes. My personal favorite was the seafood night, where they served grilled octopus and fish straight from the coast. The Italian restaurant, La Cascatta, was also charming — great pasta and a cozy setting. Drinks are included with meals in the all-inclusive package, and the poolside snack bar was perfect for a quick bite or a cocktail."

It was a real experience; I am writing this story from the reception, as I prepare to leave after my 9-day trip. Here are the positive and negative points. Pros: The staff! Amazing, very friendly and welcoming. The service is excellent, the maintenance staff is adorable and the animation team! Legend. I have befriended many people and I can only say good things about them. The food was delicious. I am usually difficult, but they offered a wide choice of dishes, from beef spaghetti to cuttlefish ink! It sounds awful, but it was really delicious. The building is beautiful, it is a nice place to spend time with friends met on site or to sit and work. Animations. I can't tell you how amazing and unique it is to have an entertainment team at the hotel. These people danced, sang, organized entertainment.  You were able to learn dances to fun songs and have fun. There is an adorable DJ who can put on the songs you want, and many great people who show a big smile for you to have a great time!"

All in all we have had a great time here."

Apart from that the hotel is very clean, the cleaners are lovely.  The Animation Team The boss Mido, speaks many languages, and puts together the entertainment, The Naughty, but cheeky Simo, he should be called wicked and thats in a nice way, he entertained us and everyone around, so beware people, he's lots of fun, the beautiful Doussa, very helpful, even went for an after drink with her, she helped in all ways she could. Of course  Nader, with his hair, smile and his cheeky side, great dancer to. The wonderful GiGi, absolutely amazing with the children,  with her crafts and toys for all ages, the kids miss her, that says it all with tears and cuddles.  And Amine, they call him Giraffe, what a lovely man, fun, enjoyed dancing. Tho the team are not professional, actors, dancers the entertainment was brilliant, which was all down to Mido, he loves his job, but the work they all put into it, you can only praise them.  The bar staff were brilliant, I have never been to such a home felt hotel, tho small, it was ideal, as all the staff helped in their own ways. I'd highly recommend, and I will certainly go back, I know some people have already booked next year and going for 3 weeks next time.  Yes I would do 3 weeks myself to.  Highly recommend"

Thank you for everything, especially you Foufa! Our son really loves you and to this day he still asks where Foufa is. Our daughter has become very friendly with Sunny and Sainab. It didn't matter at all that our kids only speak Czech. They found their way to each other.  Our big thanks also go to the others, not only to the animation team, the very nice and helpful maid, the receptionist and the really helpful, smiling and hardworking waiters and the best pasta chef right on the beach.  Tip - it would be good to focus on the cleanliness of the kids club, the safety of the climbing frames, the cleanliness of the beach and maybe find a way to not use so much disposable plastic on a daily basis!"

A little special nod to Soulef (who looked after our room 2102) who surprised us with his decorations. Pleasant, kind and smiling person. I recommend the hotel 1000 percent. On the other hand, only downside with Karim (world tourism representative) who once sold us his excursions, remained indifferent throughout the stay. Did not tell us about the operation of the hotel, gave us no explanation, which is a shame. It does not represent the atmosphere of the hotel which is however perfect. For us, this is a negative. Apart from that, congratulations to all and thank you for your welcome."

        "review_text": "We had the most incredible time during our stay at this beautiful hotel in Tunisia – from the moment we arrived, we felt so welcome and cared for. One of the absolute highlights of our experience was the amazing hotel staff, especially our wonderful cleaning lady, Soulef, who looked after our room (2105). She went above and beyond every single day, always greeting us with the warmest smile and a kind word. She made our room feel so special and romantic – we would come back to beautifully arranged towels in the shape of hearts, often adorned with fresh flowers. It truly added a magical touch to our holiday and made it feel like a romantic dream.  The hotel itself was spotless – everything was always clean, tidy, and well maintained. You could tell how much pride the staff take in keeping the place looking its best. And the food… wow! Every meal was a delight – full of flavour, variety, and beautifully presented. From local Tunisian dishes to international options, everything we tried was delicious.  We also went on an unforgettable excursion into the Sahara Desert, which was a true adventure. Riding through the vast, breathtaking dunes, visiting desert villages, and watching the sunset over the sand was an experience we’ll never forget. Tunisia is such a stunning and diverse country, filled with natural beauty, rich culture, and warm, welcoming people.  We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect holiday – everything from the hospitality to the food to the adventures made it one of the best trips we’ve ever taken. Highly, highly recommended!"

So kind and friendly, and she even surprised us with a beautiful bed display. Thank you, Soulef, for making our stay extra special!  Highly recommend this resort — we’ll definitely be back!  – James & Ivana  Only note would be that the Pool was slightly cold but was expected for the time of year we were at!"

The venue is such an awesome place that we got to love it more on a daily basis. The hotel was booked as a four star property ,  but , indeed, it was much more.                                                                                                                             I couldn't say if it was   for the great beach area, cleanliness  in general , large choice of tasty food, kindness of the stuff, great entertainment section or plenty of facilities available, but it was almost the best experience of the kind in my life.      Here I simply have to mention an outstanding group of young Tunisian people  in charge of our daily entertainment . They impress all of us by their agility, great spirit, stamina, energy, kindness, respect towards the elderly people who they treat almost as a family. They are not just doing their job,  but having a great time of life with the guests. We thank them all for everything they did to make our stay a great and unforgettable experience. The first to mention is an energetic and lovable girl named Diva, then Jordy, Nina, Casper, Rio, Fernando, Alpha, , Bobo, Kouki, Rita and Nino. This is really an awesome group of young people doing their best for the well- being of the hotel guests. I want to believe that the hotel authorities are aware of it and that they will act  and thank them for it accordingly.

In addition, this hotel will be renovated at the end of 2025.  What more to ask for!"

A big thank you to Mabrouka who cleaned and managed our rooms perfectly and always with a smile. Evening Entertainment was good especially for the little ones. The negatives, the rooms have a separate toilet with the basin in the main room. This is very annoying especially at night when someone else is sleeping. The swimming pools are freezing even in 30 degree heat. They are not heated therefore the kids didn't enjoy it and barely jumped in.  Even the indoor pool wasn't heated although the hotel insisted that it was.  The private section of the beach is clean.  The food apart from breakfast is very poor quality."

I was initially skeptical as the reviews I read were quite mixed bag, but we were honestly so happy with our experience. Firstly, I found the whole resort incredibly clean and our room was spotless each day after we returned from the pool. There is an extensive buffet with some live cooking stations each night. We found the staff incredibly friendly, always checking we were okay and interacting and playing with our daughter. The pool area is beautiful with the beach just behind. We can’t fault anything about our stay and would highly recommend this to anyone who is unsure based on some of the negative reviews. Our only regret is we didn’t bring any local currency with us so weren’t able to tip the helpful staff."

        "review_text": "I stayed at this Lovely Hotel from the 11th of May for 7 nights with my Friend & Daughter All Inclusive. The Hotel was modern & we felt safe as you had to go through the security gates to get in, also through security when you arrive with your luggage at the Hotel. Our room was nice, modern & spacious. The shower was spacious, lots of storage space, iron & ironing board in the wardrobe. There was a mini fridge with a 1L bottle of water & a large flat screen TV. We stayed in room 141 pure sunshine from 6am in the morning on the balcony and the view of the beach & the hotel next door which i don't think is in operation. The staff were so accommodating and could not do anymore for us such lovely people. We always talk to the staff as we are social people. The food lots of choice something for everyone, and everything I ate was nice no complaints. There is entertainment every evening. The cleaner came everyday a nice elderly lady who was nice. When sunbathing you can order drinks and the waiter will bring them to you or you can go to the pool bar. The beach is over the foot bridge 1 mins walk from the pool area. We done the Jet ski's with Z who is situated just as you walk onto the beach.   Special thank you to Yazziz & Yassine who looked after us so well, and accommodated us with late check out. The only thing i would say is some of the Jacuzzi's could be heated as the pools are not."

        "review_text": "Hilton  Pros - modern decor. Nice beach.   Cons - poor service and here’s why;  1. There are lots of staff rushing around but not doing much - dirty / uncleared tables - Had to repeatedly ask waiters to clear dirty tables in the canteen (worse than a school hall).  2. You’re lucky if you get offered a drink in the canteen or terrace. Again there are lots of young (mostly male) staff rushing around but not really serving guests. Although I note female, younger guests do get served fairly quickly.   3. The room was cleaned but there were hairs on the floor which were not ours! .  4. The sink blocked and we had to ask for repair (not repaired and we had to use the lever under the sink to unblock manually).  5. The towel holder glued to the shower come off (not repaired)  6. The bedding wasn’t changed at all during our week stay.   Food  - plenty of it but tasteless and limited hours:  1. Food was repetitive  2. On arrival at 10pm no food available. No room service.  Usually when I’ve stayed at other 5 star hotels options are available for guests.    Location - nice beach no amenities nearby and very dirty  1. Do not go here if you like to get out for a walk or visit a nearby coffee shop/ bar restaurant. There aren’t any. The hotel is surrounded by derelict / abandoned building projects.   2. The whole area and surrounding town / Monastir is very dirty. There is rubbish strewn everywhere.  We went to look at the nearby flamingo site. It is surrounded by rubbish and a rubbish dump.   Overall - I wouldn’t book this hotel again unless there are major changes to the service and operation.  I would go back to Tunisia as the people are lovely  just not here to this hotel. I recommend really considering this place if you want a nice vacation this is not 5 star Hilton."

        "review_title": "Good hotel but service provided and facilities available are not in line with 5 star rating.",
        "review_text": "We recently spent 7 nights at Hilton Skanes and would like to share our feedback to assist both future guests and hotel management.  1. Location & Facilities  The hotel enjoys a beautiful beachfront setting, and the pool area is spacious and well-maintained, with a convenient bar service. However, service on the beach itself was minimal—throughout our stay, we were only approached once by a staff member, and WiFi connectivity did not extend to the beach area.  The surrounding area is rather limited in terms of amenities, with just one souvenir shop nearby and no restaurants within easy walking distance (approximately 20 minutes away).  2. Service  Service levels were inconsistent and did not reflect the standards typically associated with the Hilton brand. While some staff members were courteous and efficient, many others appeared disengaged. On several occasions, we experienced delays in being seated at clean tables and had to wait 10–20 minutes for drink orders, even as multiple staff members walked past without engagement.  There were also ongoing issues with cutlery—teaspoons were unavailable, and many forks provided were bent or damaged, which was surprising and disappointing in a 5-star setting.  3. Dining Experience  The food quality was generally good, but the variety was lacking. Menus were highly repetitive, which became noticeable over the course of the week.  4. Accommodation  We opted for an upgraded sea view room, which was spacious and featured a very comfortable bed. However, the in-room mini fridge was not replenished during our stay, except for a single bottle of water provided daily by housekeeping. This felt more in line with a 3- to 4-star offering than what one would expect from a premium hotel.  ⸻  Overall Assessment  While the hotel offers a pleasant setting and comfortable accommodations, it does not currently meet the expectations associated with a 5-star Hilton property. Compared to other luxury hotels we’ve stayed in—such as those in the Iberostar and Hyatt Regency portfolios—Hilton Skanes falls short, particularly in service consistency and attention to detail.  With some targeted improvements, particularly in staff training, dining variety, and guest service, this property has the potential to provide a more satisfying and brand-consistent experience."

        "review_text": "Read a lot of reviews before booking which really helped as I think they sum it up well.  Overall a great experience.  The immediate surroundings of the hotel are nothing to shout about (a lot of buildings part built and then with COVID/tourist trade generally plummeting now empty), but 15-30 mins away by taxi (which you can easily jump in outside the hotel (haggle the price down!) you have some great exploring at your doorstep.    The good....super friendly and helpful staff overall   The cleaning, pool and restaurant staff were especially friendly.  Really clean and lovely rooms (we had a 2 bed suite as there with our 2 small kids).  Pools are lovely (but COLD!).  Early in the season so I can imagine later in the year they warm up.  Still got dragged in a number of times as the kids still loved it despite the cold.  Beach maintained daily (they can't help if lots of seaweed washes up) .  Lovely to explore Sousse and Monastir.  Stunning old city walls and fun to explore the Medina shops.  Bit of culture at Sousse archaeological museum.  Didn't find people too pushy.   If anything with kids they were more friendly than being in the UK.  Also did camel trip booked through the hotel which was really fun (they will try get you to tip/spend extra along the way, but as long as you expect that it's all ok).  There were horse and cart rides outside the hotel (just make sure you haggle the price down). I'm coeliac and they did cater to gluten free, which was great.  Could have offered more choice, but the main thing was I wasn't contamination!  Win.    Wasn't so impressed.....kids club.  Limited resources and didn't feel like they really tried to engage with my 4 year old.  There were set daily activities, but they said unless they have enough kids (which they didn't) they wouldn't do them.  All they suggested was putting on a film, which was not what we were after.  Not being all inclusive made food choices limited as there were restaurants we couldn't eat in!  Saying that it worked out cheaper for us as they allowed our small children to eat the buffet for free, which if wed gone all inclusive even my 18month old was going to be charged £50 a day for!  100tdn (around £25) for the buffet for an adult or pizza/pasta in la Luca restaurant around 40 tdn(£10) .  Small glass of wine 17tdn (£4.50) so not bad.    Overall lovely experience and beautiful hotel."

        "review_text": "One week stay in the hotel Phenicia  For 10 years I have been sailing all over Tunisia, Djerba, Mahdia, Hammamet. And this property is really in the Top 3 in terms of overall amenities. Staff: Pleasant on all floors, be it housekeepers, bartenders, receptionists, SPA people, room waiters, really perfect, smile and kindness. Meals: Interesting concept, in the morning breakfast in a place where the “Tastes” view of the main pool take place, possibility of eating out. In the main dining hall, free placement, in the evening on the other hand 2 Services, 1 from 18:30 to 19:30 and 1 from 20:00 to 21:00 fixed placement, indeed as soon as you arrive a table will be designated and you will keep it throughout the stay for evening meals, really nice which allows to have always the same server.  -Bedroom: Spacious, well appointed and always clean  Bars: There are everywhere, quality alcohols far from the other establishments that offer alcohols sometimes undrinkable, downright a Cocktail card available really TOP!!   - Buffets: really well, it is true that the quantities are much less numerous than in the other hotels, but the products are REALLY quality, in the morning the pastries are fresh, fruit pressed by hand, hot bread, with all meals dishes redone on site live, really the food is quality, maybe a little less choice than in the other establishments but we eat better.  SPA: No treatments in this SPA, only massages, I would say not bad service but could do better, massages are more of 30’ rather than 50’, on the other hand good pleasant and caring masseuses. Beach: Superb, with deckchair available, a beach attendant, a security guard who watches the few beach vendors to do some business.  - Animators / Atmosphere: Really TOP!!! Friendly and very good at animation, not insistent with people who want to stay quiet. Really TOP shows, superb atmosphere, foam evening in the pool, games the day really the Class!!!  Finally, really nice hotel whether for a trip with family, friends or in Love. I recommend"

        "review_text": "First holiday with my family since turning 18 and with several delays we finally arrived after 13 hours of travelling from Brighton, we got to the hotel after a 90 minute coach journey and was greeted with an £160 room tax, (4 people) my mum had asked tui multiple times is there any extra charges once we arrive and they said no. We were obviously frustrated by this but there’s not much you can do. There’s an optional charge for pool towels too but luckily we had bought our own. My dad has recently been marked as disabled so my mum put a note on there saying we need to be on the ground floor, however the ‘ground floor’ does have around 10 small steps up to the level of rooms  which is obviously not suitable if you are in a wheelchair as there is no lift to this floor. However this hotel has been the cleanest hotel I’ve ever been to the staff are continuously cleaning away. The room cleaning ladies were amazing mopped and changed towels every day was always leaving petals around. My holiday was from the 19th of May to the 30th (11 nights) the first two days were around 22°-25° and then unfortunately we had three days on and off rain and thunder (again staff were very on it with making sure the floor was kept dry to avoid any incidents) day 6 and 7 of our holiday was a little cloudy (16°-18°) quite nice to sit in the sun. I get very figgity when I’m too hot so it was quite easy for me to get a tan with a breeze.  I’m also a  fussy eater and I still felt catered too, this hotel freshly cooks pasta and different meat/ fish every night. By the 9th night pasta did get a little boring. There is two other restaurants but you have to pay for them. I’m not a fan of the beach however the days I did spend down there it was very hot just too many flies, lady bugs and people selling stuff. I think I’ve been bit twice on my hand but that is it, sitting by the pool you do get a lot of ants in the grass and they like to climb on bags but never entered any clothing or drinks. The pool was freezing however on a hot day with no breeze seeping your feet in definitely cooled me down.  I’m most greatful for the fact I brought a Stanley bottle with me as you only get little cups and with my cup my ice was kept cold over night.  There’s a little shop down stairs which I don’t think is too expensive there’s definitely cheaper shops outside but it’s not a total rip off. 10 dinar for a bag of crisps which is around £2.50 ( 4 dinar to 1 GBP) and to change money into cash I would advise going out of this hotel and into the next one as they have a better exchange rate 300 dinar was around £77.   Overall a really good holiday  Sun was great towards the end  Staff are amazing!  I’m not a big drinker but they had a wide range of cocktails and spirits.  Large lobby / entertainment area"

        "review_text": "Group of 3 friends who paid £400 each for a week here.   The hotel was clean, rooms tidied daily, fresh bath towels provided daily, beach is beautiful, pool area has plenty sunbeds and fresh foods available at every meal.   The staff absolutely make this hotel, with Ali from the shish place one of the most kindest and caring people we have ever met. He walked us to the disco and helped our friend who has poor mobility one night, and it was upsetting to see one of the animation team shouted at him, saying we were telling him to f*** off, and we weren’t. Tried to find a manager to inform this was untrue but couldn’t locate one. I would be grateful if a manager could reply to this review and advise they are aware of this now.   Often the only time we seen a manager was when they were shouting at waiting staff/bar staff. This was horrible to witness as most of these are young boys trying their best. To expect two staff to collect all the glasses and replenish guests drinks is a staffing issue, not their issue. These guys are so grateful to have jobs, it’s not nice to see them being shouted at.   The 5 bars as advertised is only available from 1st June, which is something I will take up with love holidays. The beach bar opened on 26th May, which meant we enjoyed time at the beach without having to walk 5 minutes each way to refill our glasses.   The food is alright. Breakfast is very egg dominated, with fresh omelettes made to order available. Lunch is the best meal, which was echoed by other guests. Dinner is rather disappointing, with the same number of dishes available at lunchtime but it feels like less selection.   The location is beautiful, as I said the beach is gorgeous. Taxis to sousse are readily available and we spent most nights in the Hard Rock Cafe nearby.   If you are looking for 4/5 star Europe, this is not the one, it is more like a 3 star, however I firmly believe nobody looks after their guests like the Tunisians which is what made our holiday."

        "review_text": "2nd time here... and been met with issues.  The main complaint is the reception area and staff, are so rude and un helpful, when we first checked in we were rushed to checked in.\"hurry fill this in\" \"you need to send us the reservation through email\"  We been told the indoor pool is closed due to it being summer its closed, we had friends that were ginger and fair skinned and wanted to swim in an indoor pool we were told we weren't allowed. After spending nearly 9k over 2 times.   The food is repetitive, bland and horrible,  The animation team only want you to play dart and silly games like that. And don't do much.  The large area on the website with the stage is just dirty and full of old rancid couches  The amenities like mini gold is run down and dead grass same as the tennis court [which i didn't even know they had] the restaurant you have to book even know its in the hotel.  The WiFi doesn't reach all the rooms.  Bar drinks are waters down with very cheap alcohol.  Travelling around the local shops all you get is bombarded with [hello hello very good price good price] after telling the locals no your hounded and often not allowed to leave the shops until you kick up a fuss.   Rooms aren't cleaned properly the sheets aren't changed frequently."

No water one day no toilets the next day the entertainment team I feel bad for but they were terrible and had no interest in the kids what so ever only the adults they wanted to annoy all day every day 😕 m we were all inclusive and you could taste the water in all the drink. You can drink the vodka straight all day and you wouldn't even have a slight be on a dunt off it 😂 realy shocking for what we paid."

        "review_text": "Arrived after a long journey to be told to wait or go for lunch to leave cases at reception, I also left my cardigan on top which disappeared by the time I got back and they knew nothing about it but that's nothing in comparison to the awful and repetitively bland food, not once out of the 10 days/nights was I able to find anything I could eat, no entertainment, only 1 bar open which had very limited drinks and if you drink alcohol you'd need to go out as it's very watered down, could not get any water, coffee or snacks outwith the restaurant at night or early morning when I paid all inclusive, my son left early which left me to be harassed by male staff then when shown I wasn't interested I was no longer being properly served in the restaurant etc, toilets wouldn't flush in all of the hotel the 1st 2 days, no water for showers later at night, cleaners mainly attended to pool area and only replaced the room towels. Went to the market with an employee of the hotel who said other clients were going then said they hadn't turned up which left him and I so I told him I wanted to go back to the hotel only to be told I had to give him more money and was then put in a taxi alone back to the hotel. The whole experience of the hotel was intimidating and spoiled my stay in Tunisia, use a different hotel, check recent reviews."

        "review_text": "Believe the negative reviews and avoid this hotel. Unsafe for solo travellers, staff harassment, poor food, unhygienic service, no privacy, unfair deposit handling. Not a 4-star stay.  I booked an all-inclusive package and had one of the most stressful travel experiences I’ve ever encountered.  From the very beginning, service at reception was disorganised and unprofessional. After checking in late at night, I was told to wait for someone to take me to my room. I sat waiting for  approx 30 minutes, exhausted after a long journey, only to be told no one was coming and that I should go on my own. There was no reason to keep me waiting that long, especially so late.  Throughout the stay, I was repeatedly approached by male staff — from the bar, restaurant, and entertainment team — asking for my number, social media, and inviting me for drinks outside the hotel. One even offered a boat trip “at no cost,” while making inappropriate comments. After I declined all offers politely, I was ignored by some staff who then refused to serve or assist me. I went there to rest and enjoy time off — not to be harassed. This behaviour was neither friendly nor flattering. It made me feel uneasy, unsafe, and unwelcome. It should not be tolerated or normalised in any hotel setting.  The towel deposit process was also a disaster. I was not informed that the receipt would be required to get the deposit back. I followed instructions exactly — paid the receptionist, gave the receipt to the pool attendant, and received the towel. Later, I returned both the towel and the plastic card (which was issued in exchange for the towel), but was told I needed the original receipt, which their staff had taken and then lost. They also lost a copy of the original receipt. The manager told me I’d have to wait three hours while they “investigated” — even though I had already checked out and was ready to leave. The error was theirs, but I was punished for it. I never received my money back.  The room was outdated and in poor condition — the bath leaked, the toilet didn’t flush properly at times, the toilet paper holder was broken, and the TV couldn’t be used without paying a deposit for the remote. Cleaners would knock once and enter immediately without asking if it was okay — even while I was inside. There were no “Do Not Disturb” signs, and no respect for privacy.  The food was repetitive, tasteless, and completely unlabelled — no allergen information whatsoever. Ice cream was served once, pre-scooped, left melting in paper cups on the counter with no refrigeration — a clear health and safety risk. Although snacks were advertised as available daily between 16:00 and 17:00, I never once saw them being served.  I was unable to connect to Wi-Fi.  Entertainment was poor and unreliable and did not follow the published schedule. The à la carte restaurant was never made available, and staff continuously pushed guests to use the on-site ATM or book private services with them directly.  I also spoke with another solo traveller during my stay who had a very similar experience, which shows this was not an isolated incident. I won’t speak on her behalf, but it was clearly a pattern.  This was not a 4-star experience. It was unsafe, exploitative, and poorly managed. Avoid especially if yo are a solo traveller. It’s not just disappointing, it’s dangerous."

Special mention about their Guest Manager, Manel, who is absolutely fantastic. She went above and beyond to ensure our stay was seamless and enjoyable. From helping with local recommendations and handling a few unexpected issues with efficiency and care, her support made a big difference. Manel was always approachable, attentive, and genuinely committed to making our experience exceptional."

Spent a lot of time at reception complaining. Told there was no hot water for over 12 hours. Bed not changed for the week we were there.Tiny veranda.  Drink…. awful all watered down. Spent £72 for litre of Smirnoff in restaurant across from hotel. (Smashed mine at airport)  Pool snacks… None, whatever was left in restaurant got put by the bar. Pizza and bread  Entertainment… good if you’re under 5. Same repetitive music …. Atmosphere… poor .. Nothing to do at night. In fact nothing to do at all. All in all I would not return to this hotel at all. How it got 4* 5* on trip advisor I do not know. I came home with 42 bites. Some really sore ones.  Shambles of a hotel. Some staff ok . No bank machine . I could go on an on …..  Grandsons enjoyed themselves so suppose that’s a bonus."

        "review_text": "Not long returned from this hotel and i have to say that this was NOT a 4 star hotel experience, 2 star at best. None of the pool or beach bars were open once, no hotel entertainment except for kids which was terrible. The room was basic with rusty pipes around the bath. The hairdressers and beauty spa ladies have no diplomas up in the shop and were clearly untrained for the job for which i had to request my money back for the awful hairstyle they gave me. It was advertised as no smoking allowed in the cocktail bar that was never open yet people were allowed to use it as a smoking area which could be smelled throughout the hotel including the room i stayed in which smelt like stale smoke the whole time. The food was okay but repetitive, very limited selection especially for breakfast which was only fried eggs and omelette or cereal. The waiters and staff were lovely, very polite and friendly and the poor maids who clean the room as best they could with what little cleaning equipment they had didnt change the bed sheets once in the 10 nights i stayed aswell as that the towels are threadbare and no good. On one of the days there was a notice on the resturant door that there would be no hot water anywhere in the hotel from 8am until midnight so nobody could shower or bath, the next day there was a sewage problem and no water to flush the toilets aswell as taht there was only 3 toilets available quite a way from the bar and resturant area. My friend and I payed nearly £2000 for this 10 night holiday and it was a disaster from start to finish. I love Tunisia have been 10 times and will return again but never to this hotel. Avoid at all costs."

Our room was ready 1 hours early so we were grateful for that. The room itself was spotless. Comes with a TV with limited channels, a mini fridge to keep your drinks cool and quite a powerful shower! Beds are lovely and comfy. Maid makes up the room every day and provides a fresh big bottle of water (no need to tip). Staff are literally so attentive and are so grateful for a tip both at the bar and at dinner service, if you are a polite person they will look after you in kind. The food was tasty and a good variety, if you ask at breakfast for a steak for dinner they will prepare one for you for dinner in the evening.  Please bare in mind that the tourist tax is per person, per room, per night so it can be quite costly if there is a large group staying for a number of nights. There's taxis always outside the hotel although flag down a blue band one on the road for a cheaper price. The shop inside the hotel is reasonably priced and the shisha is lovely. Would definitely come here again."

No refreshments available, no facilities for making a brew in the room. There was a fridge the room which was unplugged, a bottle of still water was in the room but it was warm. Very dirty bathroom .. very unhappy with our stay"

        "review_text": "I recently stayed at the Royal Victoria attracted by its fascinating history, its prime location next to the Medina and references to illustrious figures like Churchill or Puccini. The staff is definitely very friendly and helpful, which I sincerely appreciate.  However, I cannot fail to express my disappointment at the overall cleanliness of the hotel. There is visible dust on many surfaces, and the carpets at the entrance are badly damaged, with obvious stains that have been there for some time. This general neglect conveys a sense of abandonment that contrasts painfully with the quality that the building deserves.  And already the cube was finding a cockroach between that made us flee the room.   It is sad to see a place with so much potential and heritage value being dropped in this way. An improvement in cleaning and basic maintenance would be enough to restore some of the dignity that still exists in its architecture and courtesy of its staff."

Excellent location, at the entrance of the medina and al-Bahr Gate (connecting the old and new city). Colorful interior, with soft lighting and tiles on the walls. Extremely courteous service and good breakfast. There is also the restaurant, in case you are tired in the evening after exploring beautiful Tunis. I really liked the small terrace of the room overlooking Victory Square and the relaxing and very hot shower."

The traditional designs and patterns made with Tunisian tiles, which remind us of the Bey Palace home to the Bardo Museum, the hand-painted doors, ceilings, corners and attic, suddenly transport us to another time, another reality, almost like in a Michael Curtiz film with Humphrey Bogart, chased by international spies or hunting for hidden treasures."

        "review_text": "Location is great.  Right next to the medina entrance. Only took about 15min from the airport (depending on traffic).  Cost me 15 The hotel is listed as 4stars but I'd says its closer to 1-2 star based on US/EUR standards. The amenities are pretty much the bare minimum.  You get a fridge though and glass cups.  I got two waters.  Not sure if that is standard or for my two nights.  (Didn't get replenished the second day) The room is quite small but the high ceilings make it seem larger.  There are only four lights in the room (bathroom, main, and two night stands).  One of the nightstand lights did not work.  During the day, there was good light from the windows.  The room was a little dark at night.  I had a view of a rooftop. The room is rather dingy.  I judge a hotel's cleanliness by whether not I'd feel comfortable walking around barefoot.  I used slippers (that I had from the flight)  The whole room had tile.  The bathroom floor was most dirty.  Visible dirt/water stains, etc  The floor on the rest of the room was better but not much.  There were two rugs on either side that look like they've never been washed before.  The bed was not very comfortable.  Two singles pushed together with no connector.  Not very firm (not much support).  Sheets seemed clean though.  One pillow and decorative pillow for each bed. There is a tiny table with a chair.  The water and cups were on top of the fridge.  There was a closet but no place to put your suitcase. The bathroom was very small, barely enough room to sit on the toilet.  The water faucet had no screen so water tend to spray all over the place.  The shower stall bottom actually looked pretty new and clean.  The water temperature and pressure was a little hard to control.  The door didn't want to stay completely closed so you had to be careful where you pointed the wand. There was a cold/hot temperature control in the room.  It turned on a fan but the temperature of the air never changed. Breakfast was actually pretty good.  Lots a variety including local things."

It is located near the entrance to the Medina, so easy to reach both on foot and if you have a car as you can park without difficulty in the neighboring streets. The hotel is a bit “fanè”. Stairs dimly lit, terrace covered with pigeon droppings. Wi-fi not working the day we stayed there. Breakfast average. Not in line with a 4-star European.

The architecture is beautiful and the location is next to the Medina, close to the theater and a short car ride to the Bardo Museum. However the hotel is tired and run down. The pillows are horrible. The towels are worn and frayed. We booked the suite and the fridge didn’t work, the heat didn’t work, the water switched hot to cold during showers and at peak times there was almost no water pressure. The WiFi either worked perfectly or not at all. The staff was very nice and organized a good tour for us but seemed to forget to get our taxi for the airport. We asked for ice and they had none - that was a first! Worst was the cleanliness. The bathroom needs a good scrub and there was a cigarette butt on the bathroom floor the entire stay, so clearly the bathroom floor never gets cleaned. The hotel is inexpensive but I wish I had paid more for a better experience."

We were offered the upgrade to the Elizabeth suite, a beautiful very large room with sumptuous decor.  Nothing to say about that. The breakfast could be better, especially in the quality of certain products; beware for those with intolerances or allergies (my wife is celiac) because apart from eggs and fruit... it is difficult to understand even if yogurt has gluten or not.... Given the cost of one night, the value for money is definitely favorable."

Thanks for changing us. But it doesn't catch up with the rest: Hello / goodbye does not exist / if you have a drink, we do not give you change .. there is not enough deckchair at the pool ... (obviously we are not the type to go reserve our deckchairs good others yes). The so-called private beach has no deckchairs and it is a walking landfill.... We had just spent 10 days in another hotel where it was quite the opposite... honestly the difference was brutal. We had planned 5 days there, we preferred to lose money for our comfort and go to another hotel barely 500m (reception at the top by the way and quality equipment we will return there )  No idea where the 4 stars of this establishment come from but with the same budget you have much better and without misleading advertising;)  And obviously when we announced our departure, the person at the reception just said ok as if it was usual (we were absolutely not asked what was going on ) Anyway, run away."

The comfortable room and great location made my experience really enjoyable.  I would have gladly given 5 stars, but at check-out I found an error in the charge of 60 euros more. The amount was returned to me in local currency, without an exchange receipt, causing an inconvenience at the airport: it was not possible to convert the money into euros, as an official receipt is required for the exchange.  A small incident that, unfortunately, partially ruined an otherwise perfect stay. However, I recommend the structure, with the hope that more attention will be paid to these details."

As for the hotel staff they are not friendly people. Marwa the daughter of the host tried to swindle us regarding the price of a taxi 60 euros to go to the airport...The women of the hammam are not honest attention they sell olive oil cut in rapeseed or sunflower oil and she sold 4 bottles at the price of 8 euros a bottle of the flight!!! Frankly this hotel is to be avoided absolutely they are crooks!!! MeS vacation was ruined. I paid excessively for it!!!"

        "review_text": "This was my 11th holiday at the Marhaba Royal Salem in Sousse and it was yet another almost faultless brilliant holiday. However, I asked for/requested a room with a walk in shower as I've recently had a hip replacement and I still find getting into and out of a bath a little difficult. Sadly this  request was not noted, but it was quickly resolved. I was also slightly disappointed with room service..... whilst the room was always spotlessly clean, it lacked the little extra's I had on my last visit in February, the swan towels and the complimentary fruit basket, but whilst I  understand these were extra's and not part of the normal service , they were missed.  The food as always is amazing, I've read that some find it boring and bland!!!  Most definitely NOT the case. They have themed evenings, Tunisian,  Spanish Italian etc. They are amazing in that they always manage to cater for all tastes and all ages, with chips, pasta chicken nuggets and all the usual children's favourites :)  What REALLY makes this hotel standout from the others is the staff. Whatever role they have, be it waiter, cleaner, room maids, chef the guys who spend hours making sure the gardens are clean and looking their best, or the beach staff that bring you your sun lounger, they all do an amazing job, but special mentions MUST go to the animation team who work tirelessly to make sure we all have a great time. They all work really hard and it would be difficult to mention just one person, as they all deserve a special mention, but I must mention Mustapha whose job it is to make sure that everything happens on time and in the right place. He has to make sure that every member of the team knows what they have to do and where they need to be at any time of the day. So when you are watching a show or playing darts and thinking this is good...... it's good because every aspect has been planned and co-ordinated by Mustapha. His organisational and man management skills are incredible...... and it shows, well done Mustapha.   So do I have anything I don't like? Well just one........... they have sadly stopped serving alcohol on the beach. It was so nice to be able to get a nice ice cold beer when the weather is 30c plus. For reasons I'm not 100% sure of, now nothing is available, no wine with your meal.... nothing. You can still take a hike to the nearest \"other\" nearest bar and get it yourself, but the waiters are not allowed to do this for you ???  WHY?? Very strange Would I change anything........YES, please resume normal service for drinks on the beach please. Will I come back, 100% YES I have 5 more holidays already booked"

The facial was below average and to top it off there was no hot water in any of the cubicles. Walking through the corridors it seemed as if there was no attention to detail. It was more of a Holiday Inn rather than a luxury chain. Needless to say we checked out after two nights."

On the second day i finally gave up and went off to the restaurant to get a coffee.... empty restaurant and they took upwards of 15 mins to make me two black coffees!!!!  Four seasons!!!!"

The hotel really has no charm: it looks nice enough when you enter, but it quickly starts to feel like a massive labyrinth, and the rooms (at least my one - 2124) are dreadfully stale.   2. It's massive and the layout is stupidly confusing, it actually takes forever to get to your room (plus when it's rainy the courtyard areas get slippery too, making it even more annoying)  3. The location is really not great. There is nowhere to have a nice walk around the hotel, it's isolated away from anything else, so you need to get a driver and head elsewhere to see anything interesting.  4. I found the food really disappointing.   5. There seem to be way more charming / boutique type options in far more atmospheric places, for example in Sidi Bou Said. That's definitely would I'd go for on my next visit to Tunis!"

        "review_text": "We stay at Four Seasons Hotels all over the world when we travel - we just adore them! On this occasion we were staying in a nearby apartment so satisfied ourselves with a couple of visits as non residents during our stay in Tunis.  We booked in for the Christmas Eve set course dinner in Creek, which was truly one of the most exceptional and beautifully presented meals we have experienced, huge compliments to the chef and the delightful staff.  However, we were horrified and shocked to see (or smell) that smoking is allowed inside the hotel in the lounge and bar area that is situated directly adjacent (no wall in between) to the restaurant and that we had to walk through this area to access the restaurant and to go to the toilet during our meal.  We could also smell the smoke at our table.  We could not believe that a hotel group of this standard could allow smoking in a public area that cannot be avoided!    Also the lady at the next table was smoking what looked like a vape - billows of smoke everywhere!  Apparantly Iqos are allowed to be smoked everywhere inside so we had no protection.  We could not believe that we were in a Four Seasons hotel as we have never experienced this!  I believe smoking is popular amongst Tunisians, but a hotel of this standard, catering to international guests, should not allow smoking indoors.  If it has to it should be in a completely enclosed area as in some airports.   Other hotels we stayed at during our Tunisian holiday in Hammamet and Sousse were totally non smoking indoors and one we stayed at even had a non smoking area in their outdoor restaurant. I would dread to be sitting outside at the Four Seasons Tunis, in the compact area around the pool and be subjected to smoke, it would totally ruin our experience - we do have to breathe they don't have to smoke!    Clearly non smokers are second class guests at the Four Seasons Tunis so non smokers be aware!"

A week before departure, we were informed that our reservation was cancelled due to work in the hotel. We were relocated to another establishment that had nothing to do with the standing of the Iberostar Selection Eolia Djerba, which did not correspond to our expectations or our travel habits.  It is impossible for us to postpone our holidays at the last minute, nor to find an equivalent stay. We therefore preferred to cancel everything, deeply disappointed.  This is the first time that this situation has happened to us. The work is not decided a week in advance: the hotel or its partners should have warned us much earlier, out of respect for their customers.  This lack of anticipation and consideration means that we will never book this hotel again, despite its beautiful appearance on paper"

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Iberostar Eolia Hotel in October with my 10-year-old godson. I'm finally taking the time to share my experience. Used to 5-star hotels, I consider this one to be more of a 4-star. Some of the attention that makes a difference is missing, such as the daily replenishment of the minibar – here you have to go to the reception every night to request it, which I have never seen elsewhere. The bathroom is small and poorly equipped: no bathrobes and toiletries. These are small details, but they count in a hotel in this category.  Disappointing reception and unacceptable management  As soon as we arrived, an administrative problem ruined the beginning of the stay. I was asked to pay two adult tourist taxes, when my godson is only 10 years old. At reception, I was initially told that they would check, but no solution was found. I contacted my agency, which confirmed that I had to pay only one tax. The next day, at the information meeting, I raised the issue with the tourist manager, who assured me that I only had one tax to pay. He accompanied me to the reception to clarify the situation, but the discussion quickly turned unpleasant.  The unkind receptionist insisted that their system showed two adult taxes. However, I booked from the start with the correct information (surname, first name and age of my godson). Despite this, she implied that I had changed the booking. Faced with their inflexibility, I offered to wait for them to solve their problem and then pay the exact amount. But I was almost made to look like someone refusing to pay, even though it was a mistake on their part.  After tense discussions and several hours at the reception, I was finally forced to pay both taxes, otherwise I would have to vacate the room. I asked to see a manager, but no one came. Deputized, I ended up paying... cash, because the credit card was not accepted, which added further stress as I had to change money.  A few hours after my payment, I received a message from the guide telling me that the hotel was refunding me the extra tax. This whole absurd situation, which wasted my time and energy, could have been avoided with a minimum of professionalism. Worse still, no word of apology from them. I had the impression that as a single woman with a child, we were not considered a priority clientele. Since when I talked with other couples, some had fruit and champagne in their room, just after talking 5 minutes with the manager. Some also had the presentation of the complex by the manager, which we did not have.   Positive points and necessary improvements  Outside the reception, the staff was very nice: the waiters of the restaurant were very kind. The meals were good, though repetitive, with little variety over the days.  On the last day I ate grilled fish and got sick... but it can happen.  Regarding the bar, several alcohols were missing from the menu, such as Amaretto, and the bottles were not renewed there were not all week. From what I have heard, the hotel is planning many improvements to get closer to a real 5 star, especially with new infrastructure.  Conclusion  Overall, the hotel is ok: clean, well located, with a beautiful beach. However, for someone used to high-end service, there is reason to be disappointed. The à la carte restaurant is passable, without more. Fortunately, my godson enjoyed the kids club which was the main thing for me.  I probably won't come back to this hotel, as the service at the front desk significantly tarnished my experience. A good hotel not only judges its facilities, but also the quality of its welcome and service. And on this point, the Iberostar Eolia still has a lot to learn. I’ve been in several other Iberostar far better just than those of Morocco and Spain. And my neighbor will be in Mexico"

        "review_text": "I spent a stay in November in this beautiful hotel. I am a travel enthusiast and former travel agent I can tell you that I have had the chance to visit many hotels and this one is excellent. The lobby of this hotel already gives you a positive first taste of your stay. All facilities are modern and very well maintained. The beach is the most beautiful of the whole island with palm trees, and especially a large beach area since the hotel is a direct access to the beach but has respected the distance between the construction and the sea. The food is amazing from morning to night. It is excellent, there is quantity, but also quality. The orange juice pressed in the morning is extremely appreciable, this is not the case in many hotels.  Congratulations for the diversity of dishes congratulations for the service of the people who serve us at the buffet and the waiters in the room. the service and great outdoor terrace of the restaurant and just beautiful. The a la carte restaurant with sea views is a jewel. The large lively and beautiful pool the adult pool only is just as beautiful and the indoor pool is really a nice asset, really appreciable. Animators its present, but not invasive. A good team. All the hotel's waiters, waou bravo what quality service to the bars but also around the pools, at the beach. The beach towel service to change without restriction is really great and the gentlemen who give the towels are very nice. The quality of the rooms is very good for my part I had a room with sea view just beautiful is the room service with the housekeepers and high  Mini bar and snack daily in the room. Bathrobe and slippers very appreciable  The thalasso center is a gem the care is of very good quality I am used to making thalassos and I really was not disappointed. I recommend you for barca and amel massages, two professional masseuses and they are kind and very kind. At the reception of the thalasso you will meet Sara who is a really great woman, patience and very kind. All the infrastructures of the thalasso are beautiful and well maintained The board game bar very good idea c is great. International brand drinks c is rare in Tunisia and in the med basin in general. The hotel, in its totality and beautiful clean and well maintained. All the sanitary facilities in the common areas are extremely cleaned after each passage I feel. I congratulate all the staff without exception of the hotel who bends in 4 to make our stay go well, they always have a nice attention a smile and a moment of sharing. Madam Director you have great teams which allows your hotel to be amazing.  I assure you, I haven't often seen hotels so well maintained in the Mediterranean basin. Make sure you keep them, they're valuable. Thank you all 🙏 Morgan"

Everything, from the room, to the food, to the lobby was absolutely perfect.  The staff were all great and we loved the little personal touches the cleaners left in our room and how the waiter remembered us and our drink preferences. We can’t wait to come back and explore more of Djerba, with the Eolia as a perfect base. Thank you!"

The lady who cleaned my room Sassia did a great job, room lovely and clean every day.  There was a great choice of food and drink, and the restuarant staff were great as always, espicially James.  I would like to thank the guys who served you round the pool, they were always very busy but got on with it with a smile even in the very hot temperatures. A special thanks to Maher who really looked after me and also a thank you to Wissam. Ben in the main bar also done a great job. Unfortunately i can not remember everyones name, sorry.  The animation team done a great job, very busy every day, unfortunately i can only remember one name and that was leo.  I cant wait to go back and have a great time again.  So i would like to thank all the staff again from the Management to all the other employees who all did a great job."

        "review_text": "I had an incredible time at Marhaba Palace, and the entertainment team played a huge role in making my stay so enjoyable. From the moment I arrived, I could tell that the team was dedicated to ensuring everyone had a great time. They offered a fantastic variety of activities throughout the day, from fun poolside games to engaging sports sessions, catering to both adults and children alike.  The evening entertainment was something truly special. Every night, there was a new show or performance, keeping things fresh and exciting. The entertainers were full of energy and enthusiasm, and their performances—whether they were dancing, singing, or even comedy sketches—were always top-notch. It was clear they put a lot of effort into their work, and it made the whole experience feel incredibly vibrant.  What I appreciated the most was the friendly and inclusive atmosphere the team created. They always made an effort to get guests involved, whether you were just lounging by the pool or actively participating in games. It was the perfect balance of fun and relaxation, and I always looked forward to what the next activity would be.  If you're staying at Marhaba Palace, I highly recommend participating in whatever the entertainment team has to offer—you won’t be disappointed!"

        "review_text": "Amazing hotel with fantastic staff who can not do enough for you. This has been my 3rd visit now and honestly can say I have never found fault but certainly this time around it feels the service has gone up a notch. There are staff and managers everywhere!! Always checking if everything is OK. If you need or have a problem it's sorted within minutes which is very rare in this day and age. The rooms are spacious and definitely recommend a sea view room. No hidden extra costs either as safe, bathrobes, slippers, beach towels, sunbeds on the beach are all free!! Rooms are cleaned daily to a high standard. Great choice of food and drinks also. Daily activities and entertainment is very good and definitely worth a watch!! All the staff work extremely hard and make the whole holiday enjoyable. Spoke to many single female travellers which just shows how safe they feel. Highly recommend this great hotel. Many thanks xx"

        "review_text": "We booked an eleven night all-inclusive holiday here, through Tui, from 31st March to 11th April.  This is described as a four star hotel, oh dear slight exaggeration, two stars at a push and that's generous.  We have stayed in other hotel chains the brand their superior hotels as a Palace, this Hotel's use of the word palace did not have to same connotation.  Our fifth floor double bedroom, with it's high arched ceiling, was equipped with a wall mounted television, along with tea and coffee making facilities.  There was a small fridge in the room, this was classified as a mini bar, there was nothing in it, no drinks were supplied. A large bottle of water was left in the room on a daily basis.  There was air-conditioning which multitasked as a heater, the air-conditioning was not working, so the only air circulation was when the balcony door was open during the night.  The view from our balcony, overlooked the roof of the indoor swimming, out to sea and over to Port El Kantaoui   Bathrobes and slippers were provided, the robes like the bath towels were a but thin and threadbare.  The bed was was comfortable, however, the bed linen was stained at times.  We did have issues with the quality and supply of food available in the Main Restaurant and the A la Carte, both reviewed separately.  The main bar, Bar Salon, reviewed separately, was open daily from 09.00am till midnight. Local drinks were served, thankfully the local beer Celtia was okay.  There was also a pool and swim up bar, reviewed separately, which was open daily  from 10.00am till 17.00, weather permitting, we did have some rainy days.  The Lobby was a vast area with a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling, a fountain and sections created using carved panels.  There were also numerous interesting paintings hanging on the walls around the hotel.  Appreciate that it was very early in the season and the hotel and not all the bars, restaurants and other facilities had opened up yet. Unfortunately, those that were open could not cope with the volume of guests that were there.  There were two outdoor pools, one saltwater and the other fresh water and chlorinated. There was also a kiddies pool as well as an indoor pool.  However, we did prefer to use the beach, the hotel did have an section of beach which was for the sole use of hotel guests. There were sunbeds and static umbrellas along the beach and a lifeguard would bring a mattress down to your bed. At times it did get rather windy on the beach, on those occasions we found ourselves a spot around the pool.  Beach towels were provided from the kiosk near the pool, however, they were prone to running out.  The Port of El Kantaoui was accessible from the Hotel, a short walk along the road or a 700 metre walk down the beach"

I have to say I have never felt so relaxed and happy 😊 This hotel is truly one of the best I’ve stayed in if not the best 💯 From as soon as you arrive you are welcomed and taken care of. I travelled as a family party of 6 and each one of us could not fault the experience at all. The food was delicious every night, plenty of choice and always piping hot ! The waiters especially Marwain & James made our times in the restaurant so much fun 🤩  The waiters work tirelessly and were an absolute asset to the hotel. I’ve never been anywhere with such friendly attentive service and this is what made my holiday such a delight. Service always with a smile and so very professional.  The cleaners in our rooms were also so friendly and As for all toilets dotted about the hotel they were always well kept and immaculate with wonderful touches like rose petals on the sink and pleasant smelling oils..  Lastly I would like to give praise to Youssef “The fish man” what a wonderful guy! Not only did he do an amazing job of my feet he really knew what he was talking about. My feet were in very bad condition and he has given them life again! Youssef was so informative, gentle. And just a lovely guy! I will definitely be coming back for another fish spa treatment.  Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anybody! It really does have such a lovely atmosphere. We also enjoyed the entertainment by the animation team daily & nightly! These guys work exceptionally hard. Always something for everyone! The Arabian night & light show were our favourites!  Thank you to everyone at Marhaba Palace for making our family holiday special! We will DEFINITELY be back, with even more of the family !!!! Think I’ve found my forever happy place 😍🏝️🎉"

        "review_text": "We have just come back from a weeks holiday at this hotel . Absolutely stunning hotel , spacious , clean and welcoming .Gated security at the front . The room we had was on the 4th floor . Beautiful large room overlooking the front of the hotel . Tea and coffee facilities but no milk , and bottled water was changed daily . Cleaned daily with fresh towels . The chambermaids were all friendly and always wore a smile . The food was amazing and delicious.  We loved EVERYTHING  we ate . Plenty of choice , fresh fruit , fish , meat , pasta , salads . There was something for everyone . It was nice to try Tunisian food and something a bit different from the norm . The waiters in the restaurant were amazing . They were so polite , attentive and pleasant. We really felt spoilt and cared for .  On the last night we tried the A la Carte dining which we found a little disappointing.  We were expecting Tunisian food , but instead it was mainly English food and some of it was quite cold .  The entertainment was good . We enjoyed what the hotel had to offer .Especially enjoyed The Golden Girls drag act . Shout out to the animation team who work tirelessly all day and night to ensure the holidaymakers have a good time . Shout out to Sophie , who was such fun and remembered our names throughout our stay . Drinks are local brands and are in keeping with the usual all inclusive package . The service from the bars was exceptional.  The waiters couldn't do enough for you and every single one of them was polite , professional and welcoming . A special mention to Badii and Salah who went above and beyond to give amazing service . The beach bar , just a short stroll past the pool was a lovely little spot where we enjoyed lunches and drinks . Salah the manager there was such a wonderful host , along with Naheed and the other young waiters . They were so much fun and we enjoyed our time there very much . The pools were cold but there was plenty of sunbeds , chairs tables around the pool area . Whilst we were there we enjoyed an excursion on the pirate ship . Special mention to Hichem who was such a lovely man . He was so informative , professional and friendly . He didn't pressure us into buying an excursion but gave us lots of information of what to expect on the ship . The pirate ship was all that he had described and was well worth the money . Amenities around the hotel were only a short distance away . The Port was a ten minute walk away as was the Hannibal Park fountain , which we had the pleasure of seeing in all its glory . Hannibal theme park is next to the fountain . Sousse Mall is only a short taxi ride away . Only downside to venturing outside was the locals trying to get you to buy there wares,   which can be a bit off putting .  We can't recommend this hotel enough . First class service from everyone . A million THANK you's to everyone for making our holiday so special x"

The rooms are great and cleaned daily only fault is for tea and coffee facilities, they leave an assortment of tea bags, 2 sachets of coffee and sugar. No milk, strange. Bottles of water are left daily.  The hotel it's self, might have been a 5 star in the beginning now it is low 4 high 3. Needs some work to bring to a higher class.   The food is great, there is something to eat for everyone. Just remember it isn't English food. You want English food, stay in the UK or go to Spain. There are plenty of choices. The restaurant staff are fantastic and friendly. Can the cats be kept out of the main restaurant. Not everyone likes cats rubbing their bodies against you while dining.  Bars. The drink is plenty full, local spirits and beers. A small cocktail list though pre-mixed. Staff again are very friendly and attentive.  Pool, plenty of sun beds, why do people go down at 06:00 put towels down then not go back for hours. The pool bar could do with an update, currently half is in use. Weather they increase it in the summer, not sure.   Animation team. Good entertainment,they don't go bugging you while eating or sun bathing. Yes they come past and ask, say no. They leave you alone. No pressuring to join in, no nagging to buy bingo cards. They do their best to keep you entertained. The usual water aerobics and games.   Over all a very enjoyable holiday."

        "review_text": "Lovely pool areas, plenty of sun bed & parasols. Rooms are dated, we had to try 3 rooms as issues with all of them, black out blinds don't close, shower tray leaked, safe & television didn't work. Air conditioning was working either, we ended up leaving the patio doors open. you can hear people  in the their rooms too, especially when they are moving chairs for some reason. Daily  room cleaners don't do great job, forgot to leave towels & water, empty bins, basic stuff which you would expect to be done. Staff are amazing especially in the restaurant, you get to sit at the same table most of the time, just to note that you have to choose if you want 1st sitting for dinner @ 6.30 pm or wait until 7.45 pm for 2nd sitting.  Food does get a bit repetitive & cold. If like salad & pasta you will be fine, French fries & bread plentiful. There is a guy who does fresh orange juice @ breakfast but be prepared to queue. Themed nights, not all food labelled so you don't know what you are eating until you try it & there is a lot of waste then, plenty of sweet treats & fresh fruit. Staff also in the bar areas are polite, friendly they get to know your drinks order. Good beach location & again plenty of beds, restaurant/bar there also so easy for drinks & late breakfast & lunch if you didn't want to go to main restaurant.  All communal areas are exceptional clean, including the toilets( be aware that you can't flush toilet paper down any of the toilets, put in the bins provided)  You can walk into the harbour area less than 10 minutes but be prepared to be pestered by the bar staff,  sales teams trying to sell you trips, to be honest wasn't worth the walk, the area very run down & full of rubbish!  Animation team work hard around the pool area all day getting you involved with games etc. Live music in the bar area, pianist was amazing & saxophonist  wasn't bad either, but again gets really busy in there, they had to take the tables & chairs from outside to accommodate people & this is not main season.  Wouldn't class this as a 5* maybe 3.5 at best, wouldn't recommend & wouldn't go back."

        "review_title": "Honest Review from a Family of Five",
        "review_text": "We’ve just returned from 10 days at One Resort Aqua Park & Spa and wanted to leave an honest, thoughtful review—especially for other families weighing it up. It’s a resort with a lot of heart, and while it’s not perfect for us, we had a really good stay overall.  What we loved:  The setting is stunning—whitewashed bungalows tucked among palm trees, lush greenery, and a truly beautiful beach with turquoise water and soft, pebbly sand.  The staff were incredibly friendly, especially with our baby—there’s a real love for children here. Expect cuddles, kisses, and lots of warm attention from waiters and animation staff alike. It might be surprising at first if you haven’t been to North Africa before, but we found it genuinely sweet and helpful.  The buffet food was great for an all-inclusive. It can be busy and a bit chaotic at peak times, but head to the quieter areas at the back of the restaurant—mornings had fresh donuts and lovely quieter corners.  The fish à la carte restaurant was a great experience—fresh and well done. The Tunisian à la carte, however, wasn’t nearly as good (oddly, the Tunisian food in the buffet was better).  The spa was wonderful—we did the 2-day package with hammam, massages, seaweed wrap, and hydrotherapy. A great treat, though do haggle or check prices, as we found we paid more than others for the same services.  The resort is spotless. I was often up early with the baby and saw dozens of staff scrubbing floors and cleaning everything thoroughly. It’s clear they take pride in keeping it immaculate.  The beach is the most peaceful part of the resort. With the animation team being quite lively in the pool and stage areas (lots of dancing, music, and energy), we often escaped to the beach for quiet and calm.  The lazy river and pools are fun and spread out—great for families with kids who enjoy activity.  Tipping makes a big difference: We always tip on all-inclusive holidays, especially when we see how hard the staff are working. It really showed here—staff went out of their way for us: beautiful towel and flower displays in the room, bringing drinks to the table, helping us get the best tables at mealtimes. We didn’t spend much overall, but tips felt meaningful and appreciated.  Things to know / could be improved:  There’s no hotel info in the rooms or via app—events like the Tunisian parade night (Mondays 6.30pm) by the beach aren’t mentioned anywhere. A printed schedule would be really helpful.  Cocktails are poor quality (which we’ve found common in this region), but Tunisian wine is surprisingly lovely, and the coffee from the urns is excellent.  The ice cream bar only opens 12–5 and the portions are tiny—a bit of a let-down for kids. We’d have loved it open from mid-morning.  Plastic spoons at dessert are not ideal—especially for toddlers. We stopped taking them because our baby nearly choked. A switch to proper cutlery would make a big difference.  Room upgrades matter. The standard family room was too small for our family of five, so we upgraded to a superior family bungalow for an extra £225—and it made the stay far more comfortable. Also, avoid rooms in the 100s if you have a pram—they’re upstairs. Room 49 was perfect for us.  There are some resort quirks—like towel card confusion (we returned ours but were still nearly charged), TV remote with no batteries, weak air con in some rooms, not enough sockets etc. Small things that mean it’s not quite a 4-star experience—but a very solid 3-star-plus.  Day trips & local tips:  We visited Sousse and Monastir by taxi (worth noting hotel taxis are very overpriced—we paid 140 TND for a return to Sousse that should have cost about 40).  If you only have time for one, Monastir is easier to get around, with a great square for kids and lovely beaches. Sousse has the cultural edge with its medina—Café Kasbah is full of charm.  Tunisia’s currency is controlled, so exchange rates are the same at the hotel as anywhere else. Dinar is helpful, but Euros or Pounds are widely accepted too.  Weather note for May–June: We didn’t realise until we arrived, but being beside the Salt Lakes means this area is a mosquito hotspot during breeding season. We were bitten quite a bit, so for families with young children, we’d recommend coming outside of May–June if you're choosing this area again.  Final thoughts: We paid around £1,850 for 10 nights all-inclusive, plus the upgrade and tips. We wouldn’t return, only because we prefer quieter, smaller resorts—but we still had a genuinely enjoyable time. For those looking for a lively, family-friendly place with beautiful surroundings, it’s excellent value for money.  And if you want to see photos, videos etc, I’ve shared everything over on my page: @freedomfamilytravel  Happy to answer any questions if you're planning to visit!"

Several swimming pools a little cool but nice because you always find room! The meals are varied and good. The activities are great thanks to the animators of the mini club Mouna, Touta, Estefania and Maelys who make the holidays of the little ones magical and set the mood with their mini disco. At the spa you can do beauty treatments with Loubna she is great and also braid with Zeineb who is adorable and very gifted thanks again for my 2 daughters <3"

We stayed in rooms 110 and 111. Neither room had a proper working safe- this was a disaster trying to get sorted. The water didn’t drain from the shower in 111 either. Then we move onto the big problem!! We all got bitten while there- we thought it was mosquitos as there is definitely a problem with them around the Resort. Came home to discover that it’s actually bed bugs!! Fantastic!!   On checking out no room was available for us to keep on so we had to use the shower room to get changed.. I’ve seen better on “worlds worst jails” they are stinking of urine, the water is freezing and they have cctv cameras in them!   The food is questionable.. breakfast being the only decent meal. Then when you go to leave the hotel the taxi drivers try to rip you off! I’ve been to Tunisia many times and if this would have been my first time I would never return.   The hotel needs to up its game regarding food and pest control. Never ever again!!"

Entertainment team were very good.  Foam party in the pool was amazing.  Food was OK, could be better.  Everywhere was clean all the time.  Would we go back, YES, my grandchildren were crying on the way back to the airport as they didn't want to leave, they had a fantastic holiday.

They put 100% effort into everything from 9am to 11pm with a smile on their faces  Big love to the whole team ❤️  The hotel overall is really clean and rooms are cleaned daily with towels washed and beds made.   The food is nice. I’m vegetarian so struggled a bit as not everything is labelled that clearly, but there is plenty to eat and they have themed nights throughout the week.  The beach bar is open for food and drinks 24 hours a day.   Tips really go a long way! Tip your waiter and they will save you a table and have your drinks ready, tip your maid and you get freshly picked flowers on your bed etc  Overall, the staff are lovely, so welcoming and there is always something to do/see.   100% recommend this hotel if you want to visit Tunisia 🇹🇳"

        "review_text": "The hotel was in a nice position on the beach. Close to shops, banks & cafés. The hotel itself was a little dated but spotlessly clean. Room was basic, the air con was useless. No plugs beside the bed. Only 2 plugs by the dressing table. Shower kept going hot then cold. Tip: take some extra hangers. Bed nice & comfy.  Beach bar wasn't serving any snacks or food until high season apparently. Only served wine, beer & soft drinks.  Pool area kept tidy. Sammi the pool attendant/lifeguard was an absolute star. Waiters are always on hand to get you drinks from the bar, especially Eshem & Falid. They went above & beyond.  Food in the restaurant was a bit samey but ok. Plenty to choose from though.  Snacks were served in the a la carte restaurant but looked like all leftovers from breakfast, lunch & dinner (bit disappointed)  The entertainment team was always around trying to get you involved in various activities.  All the Staff we encountered was very friendly throughout the hotel.  Tip: if you get a taxi into Sousse Medina, make sure you turn your wristband inside out before you get there. There are scammers that  say they work in the hotel & it's their day off, and they offer to take you round various government backed authentic shops. It's a rip off. Please do not be fooled."

We had the best service from all waiters especially those at the beach bar (waiters and the security). Lots of friends and memories were made. Animation team super friendly and would take time to sit and chat during breaks.   Rooms were comfy and always clean. Our lovely cleaner would leave cool towel swans which was nice to come into after a long day.   i would recommend this hotel to anyone. We will be returning this year :)"

        "review_text": "Stayed as a couple a week ago. Hotel doesn’t look as flashy from the outside compared to others, when you pull up but the warmth of the staff and amenities make up for that. We stayed in the main royal building and had a distant seaview which was lovely and the room was spotless. Maids always cleaning everywhere in the hotel! The only issue is there’s only one plug socket in the room and the air con doesn’t come on til june (a Gov rule), which was hard as it was 38 degrees when there, so sleeping was hard. Quite noisy if neighbours are stomping about upstairs as no soundproofing. A nice walk in shower and quick lifts. Staff were lovely and we felt if you tip them (just a small amount to us)  you’ll get better service, so worth doing. We did a walkabout video on YouTube (badcrumblexxx) which may help you. We felt the hotel was lower budget when there but having looked at hotels since, it’s actually not. The food was really lovely for all meals with a good selection. I wish I’d used the gym (best I’ve seen in a hotel) as I put on lots of weight! Animation team worked very hard. We stayed by the small pool as it was quiet. The slide pool is salt water which wasn’t so good. Only thing is perhaps not so good for disabled people, no lift to lower pool or dining room. It’s a large complex so quite a bit of walking one end to the other. The spin class music was deafening which was annoying but only happens every so often and lots of smokers in the public areas which wasn’t so nice if you don’t smoke.  We had a fab stay and would def stay again but only when the air con was on! Special thanks to Said, Lotfi, Aziz and Alexander. All of who looked after us beautifully."

        "review_text": "This hotel as goods and bad points firstly we will go for the good the hotel is lovely all public areas are cleaned constantly and room was cleaned everyday fresh towels everyday the hotel is huge the kids pool was amazing and most importantly the staff are friendly nothing is too much trouble and fablous with the kids once you find your bearings around the hotel and it's sister hotel it's easy to get sround it's like it's only little village with all its little walk ways the down side for us and it  let down the most was the food it did have some positive like fresh made pasta that kids lived off and fresh pizza. The breakfast lacked options simple things like mushrooms and hash brown there wasn't lot of fresh fruit options and lunch and tea there wasn't lot of choice either lots of liver the theme nights had the best options also the beach bar there was lots of flies and really hard to find a seat. Also tye kids club could of been advertised more they didn't really come around asking if the kids wanted to go and what's was happening each day the animation team was lovely but felt it was more towards the adults games instead of both adults and kids. We would maybe go back again if the good options improved."

The team behind the show did an amazing job throughout the entire day, keeping the energy high and making sure everyone was entertained. Their enthusiasm and dedication were evident in every activity they organized, and it really made a big difference in how enjoyable the day was.  Each part of the show was thoughtfully planned and executed, appealing to both children and adults alike. The characters were engaging, the storylines were captivating, and the performances were lively and full of excitement. Whether it was games, music, dancing, or interactive skits, there was never a dull moment."

There were plenty of sunbeds always available, just ask the lifeguards and they will get one for you,  thank you to Ahmed.  The bar and restaurant staff were brilliant,  special thank you to Hamsa and Mohammed.  It is obvious who the leaders of the animation team were, but the other guys were the friendliest,  Momo, Foden, Sam, Chadou,  Bibo, Ziko and Patricia.  The food was plentiful and tasty, always such a selection and very fresh. Spoke to the guys at the fitness suite,  but declined to take part in a spin class, but Younes was very polite, knowledgeable and helpful. I am definitely hoping to come back,  thank you all again.  🙏"

What makes this property particularly interesting is its structure: several resorts, each with its own pool and bar. In total, there are three outdoor swimming pools, an indoor pool, three or four bars, as well as two restaurants, one of which is by the sea.  The room was spotless, very clean, with stunning sea views, everything is functional and quality. The drinks included in the all inclusive formula are excellent, and the food is tasty. The staff is friendly and always smiling. A special mention to Hamza of the bar service, which does a remarkable job at the pool – thanks to him!  I will definitely return to this hotel which really impressed me."

There is plenty of wardrobe space  and a nice tv but only news channels in English but that’s ok you do not get a information book in your room so you have to ask where things are in the hotel We found the food plentiful and tasty and the waiter’s are very good and friendly and the local drinks are nice the entertainment doesn’t start till about 9 pm in the evening there’s two places that have evening entertainment  We used to walk into Sousse and we got the train a couple of times once to El Jem and once to monastir which Dacia lot of money if you do get a taxi don’t get from the guys by the hotel get them on the street and ask the price  I think the hotel is good value for money and would go there again it just needs more information and to start the entertainment earlier"

        "review_text": "Firstly, the downsides. This is a wonderful hotel surrounded by palm trees, with a great location, manicured lawns, magnificent flowers, a big swimming pool and a monumental lobby, but the rooms need serious renovation. We arrived in a large group and settled into five rooms, but each one had some kind of problem. Our bed was huge, with a very good mattress, but the rest of the furniture is apparently still the same that miraculously survived the destruction of Carthage by the Romans. We paid a tiny price for our holiday, but during the high season, expectations in a four-star hotel are usually higher. The saddest thing is the state of the plumbing, and if it is not noticed in the nearest future, all the leaks in the bathroom and toilet will destroy this excellent hotel and there will be nothing to restore. I highly recommend the owner of the hotel to take care of this issue.  Well, now about the pleasant things. The food in the restaurant is very diverse, with national flavor, there are a lot of dishes from different types of fish, there is always lamb, beef, chicken in the assortment, king prawns are fried on the grill, and I have never eaten tastier strawberries in my life. The bar serves a variety of cocktails, and the quality of the local wines was a pleasant surprise. The service staff does not always speak English, but they understand gestures and facial expressions very well, so there were no problems with communication. There is a shower, toilet and a small bar on the hotel beach, but if I am not mistaken, you have to pay for drinks there. The sea is great, we swam every day, but there is one unpleasant moment. There is an endless chain of vendors with various crap walking along the beach like ants and very-very-very-very insistently offering their goods. They became so annoying that at first I wished to drown one of them in the sea so that fear would make the others avoid our hotel along a large perimeter, but perhaps reducing competition would have led to the opposite result, so I had to abandon this idea.  Finally,  it is necessary to mention the animation team. Here is a very simple piece of advice. If you are not a public person, do not like excessive  attention and do not want to become the star of the hotel, just stay away from these smiling gangsters. Especially beware of two named Mic and Simo. For example, no one warned us about their  insidious plans and we followed them to the show as audience but the next day I woke up famous, got a stage name and spent the rest of my vacation walking around the  hotel with a bag over my head to be unrecognized.  I hope you read to the end. A huge thank you to all the hotel staff for a wonderful holiday. Wish you the best ever season. We got fabulous four-star service for the price of a bed and breakfast.  Miss Mouradi"

        "review_text": "The El Mouradi El Menzah hotel is located in an exceptional location (facing the sea, in Yasmine Hammamet) but clearly suffers from a lack of maintenance and quality management. If you are looking for a quiet, clean and well organized stay, this is probably not the right choice. If you are flexible, the sea view and the beach are your priorities, and you accept very limited comfort, then this may be possible... on a low budget. Personally, I would not recommend it unless you get a very cheap offer and your expectations are really minimal. The \"sea view\" experience should not compensate for problems of hygiene, food or comfort. Good luck 💖💖"

        "review_text": "I don’t even know where to begin, on arrival was placed in a different hotel due to it being closed. Hotel room is mediocre at best. DONT get all inclusive there’s barely anything offered to drink and it’s all bottles poured into tiny drinking cups. All drinks are luke warm it’s terrible.  No wifi unless sat in the lobby of the opposite hotel.  Only one pool is allowed to be used- the slides seen in pictures are barricaded off and not allowed to be used. The hotel in the picture is not used for anything but sleeping they send you to another hotel to do everything else.  Hardly any communication if your English- if your french it’s a little better but hardly. Nothing to do all day sat by the pool.  Let’s get into the food/breakfast/dinner experience-  It’s like a swarm of wasps attacking something- I’ve never seen anything like it everyone is fighting for food pushing snatching food not even using the tongs provided- non of the food is labeled you have to guess what they are.  The food is not catered for British or European people- not that we was bothered but some meals we missed completely.  Along with the lack there of communication- finding where to go to get food or the toilets is a game of survival of the fittest. In the dining hall there are limited number of seats and they prioritise people with different wristbands and will tell you NO if you try to sit down but then if you try to leave with your food to eat elsewhere they will follow you shouting.  If you ask questions or ask for something IE cutlery or cups they simply look at you in disgust and walk away.  We booked to stay for one week and have never been so unhappy with the service and the hotels hospitality.  If you ask me the hotel is in need of proper management and hospitality training.   Waste of my money and time"

Was told a key would be available to us after breakfast... we had to wipe everything down before unpacking... went down on Sunday for breakfast... forget anything English. The food wasn't catered at all for British people.. couldn't even had a croissant as no butter, jams, cheeses or hams. Couldn't get drunk as the spirits in the all inclusive were watered down. The furniture in the room was battered and rotten. The balcony paint was flaking. Our safe wasn't working do was told a replacement was being sorted.. this didnt materialise. The beds are like sleeping on the floor and the pillows are like sandbags, I woke up aching every morning. The 2 good things about this hotel are the pool and the hospitality staff. The bathroom flooded everytime we had a shower as the shower curtain was letting the water through. Be aware when walking about as you will get hassled all the time to go in the shops. Cigarette but outside the lift for 3 days.. Avoid avoid avoid."

We noticed how dated the furniture was and how threadbare and dirty the carpets were. The balcony banister was rotting and unsafe to lean on. The bathroom bath had rust stains and the coating on the base of the bath had rotted away! Tiling must have been done by a chimpanzee! We complained and was given keys to check another room. This had a carpet that had a large section out and stuck back down. The carpet was absolutely filthy! Human hair balls matted into carpet! The third room we were offerd was habitable although the hairdryer was broken and there was only one plug socket to charge items! The hotel is massive with lots of pools and spa center. But needs A LOT OF MONEY spent to bring it up to 4 star! The maintenance staff need sacking as signs of shoddy workmanship everywhere! There seems to be lots of managers loafing around but no one correcting the faults within the hotel! Location is excellent, right next to beach. Could be an amazing hotel if money and proper management were spent on it!"

All meals are served with Dry rocky bread and omelets are full of egg shells impossible to eat. The inclusive deal covers the cheap low quality drinks while those who want quality have to use the exclusive side bar where you can pay for quality. The Hotel cash point charges interest rate to use on top of a commission of 10 Dinar on each withdrawal. One can only withdraw 300 Tunisian local currency at each time. The agents authorized by the hotel to organize excursions charge ripoff fees. If you are stupid enough to ignore my comments and still book a trip to Tunisia please arrange your preferred tours from home before you travel. Also carry enough money to eat from out, unless off you love oranges. Those reading after booking good luck."

Says it’s a 4* hotel but in reality more like 1*.   Rooms are awful, beds rock hard and pillows are lumpy and full of stains.   The all inclusive food on offer is quite simply vile. No options for children. We have eaten out everyday which defeats the purpose of booking an all inclusive. The dining hall is rotten. We was violently sick 3 days out of 5.   We couldn’t wait to leave and fly home. I would never visit Tunisia again. Love Holidays should take this hotel off their option list."

        "review_text": "I hope you are seated with a cup of your favourite beverage to hand...  First time writing a review for a hotel stay. El Mouradi El Menzah  No safe in room so had to carry all valuables with us all times  Hair on floors and bathroom sink Broken shower handle so the head did not stay in place  Key stopped turning on second day No telephone in room to call reception so every problem required a trip downstairs and back  Telephones are for show and connect to nothing!  Shower gel not replaced so had to keep asking daily  Poor wifi in lobby and none in rooms Second floor call button in lift stopped working on second day  Very old and dated decor which needs serious renovation. The next door hotel looked much better.  Food was bland or unusual tasting. Few options for children. Not much variety and there was always a long queue for anything you wanted. They need more food stations and service staff.  Second day a very large group of youngsters from a football academy came for their stay. Oh boy! Dinner was like pigs rushing for the trough. The restaurant didn't use both sides of buffet to speed things up. Plates ran out and one man almost fought the restaurant manager on duty over it. Tables were short and guests were nicking chairs from other tables, at one point some guests were eating standing up! Guests had to clear their own tables because the servers were so overwhelmed. There was no consideration of the extra 100+ generally-always-teenage boys that would be coming to dinner. One of them got so cross with a granny trying to cut in that it looked like he might shove her to the back of the line! Chaos is not the word but I do not what is.   Same plate shortage happened on day. Abismal"

Bottom line - very underwhelming compared to my previous experiences at similar price points (albeit the comparison is to mexico and turkey)  Things I liked:  Inexpensive overall Nice staff  Enjoyed the food  Lovely beach  Nice pools  Clean   Things I didn't like:  We arrived at night after the restaurant had closed. They gave us a plate of cold food (salad, cured meats, a boiled egg). Underwhelming and not what we are used to at other all inclusives.  No entertainment  Lack of atmosphere at the hotel  Lights would be switched off at around 11pm despite people being sat in the lobby.  Running out of drinks  Not having beach towels (even early in the day e.g. midday)  Menus / brochures only being in French  AC not being on half the year regardless of temperature  Being charged extra for the gym (seriously?? I've never seen this before at a 5* all inclusive)"

Nice touch. Porter took our cases to our room. We had booked a beach bungalow. It’s basically a lovely room, with a terrace and direct access onto the beach. Away from the main part of the hotel. So tranquil, beautiful views of the sea. Robes and slippers provided, tea and coffee facilities, small fridge with fresh water everyday. The beach is beautiful, great bar, look out for Kareem the bar man. So lovely and helpful. The beach is so relaxing. The restaurant is amazing, something for everyone! Oysters! Wow. Our waiter, Lefty, looked after us like Kings and Queens.  I only have 1 fault with the place, no Prosecco! What’s that about lol. Pushed me out of my comfort zone, gin and mojitos are my new faves😍 Tunisia is a beautiful country with beautiful people.  This hotel is amazing and we will be sad to leave ❤️   of the hotel.

        "review_text": "This is one of the best hotels we have stayed at. After an almost 4 hour flight delay, we arrived to be greeted by the hotel staff and quickly escorted to the lunch area, which closed in 30 minutes of our arrival - very thoughtful as  they anticipated our fatigue and hunger after an almost 11 hour travel time from home to the hotel. The food throughout our stay was '5-star': sushi, oysters, vegetarians, meat-eaters or fish-lovers - all our catered for, as was our sweet-tooth - their desserts and patisserie area could respectfully rival any in France. Equally, the A La Carte Italian seafood restaurant experience was one of the many food highlights of our trip. Our room was spacious and peaceful, with air-con and a lovely balcony with an ocean view, that also overlooked the 3- pools, including an infinity pool. Our room was cleaned daily and the hotel was spotless and had a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant staff were also kind and thoughtful. The indoor pool and Thalassa was used by us. The entertainment was low-key and 'chilled' (singers, musicians and dancers); however, the bonus of having access to the sister hotel, next door, meant that we could see 'shows' and access a disco and a range of day entertainment for adults and children for free. Absolute excellent value for money. Thank you Zainab, Chokra  and the whole team."

We opted for a standard room, which was spacious, well maintained, with a king size bed and partial sea views, but one small note: the air conditioning was not turned on, although it was a little hot (26-28°C) for a month of May. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful, especially the chefs, who are very responsive. The buffet offers a nice variety, although the pastry section could be improved. The pools are superb, as are the sea views, and the burkini is allowed for veiled women, which is a plus. I recommend this hotel without any hesitation. I share with you some pictures"

Waiters are doing exceptionally good job in all 3 restaurants on site. Variety of food in the main restaurant is simply amazing - there was something to suit all tastes, no matter where in the world you came from - pizza, pasta, grilled fish, beef goulash, salad, etc and lots of fresh bakery, also plenty of fruit and desserts.   There are also several pools, spa center, indoors and outdoors chill lounges. Very conveniently in the hotel area (10 metres away from hotel entrance) there is Le Grandes Bazaar - local shop where you can buy souvenirs, clothing, carpets, cosmetic and other stuff surprisingly at a very decent price.   Simply the best hotel in Hammamet.   Thank you!"

The staff at the front desk is very kind as well as the maids.  We are satisfied with our room except the soundproofing, we heard the noises from outside and the lobby until 1:30 in the morning this night.  We had sent an email to find out if there was a gym, a positive response from the hotel but on site we were surprised to discover that you had to pay 50dinars a day to access it.  The pictures of the hot tub attractive on the ad but it is only accessible by taking an additional option that is not indicated on the site."

Despite paying for an upgraded room with a balcony, I was given the wrong room because they had overbooked — no apology, no refund, just shrugged off.  To make matters worse in the early hours of the morning, a staff member entered my locked room without knocking while I was completely naked. I felt terrified, violated, and utterly unsafe. The staff member ran off without saying a word, and I never received an apology.  To make matters worse, I’ve had to go back and forth with both the hotel and the booking provider, only to be gaslit and told it never happened despite them having CCTV footage and email evidence.  No accountability, no empathy, no proper apology. This was a serious breach of safety and privacy and I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. Completely traumatising and disgracefully handled."

Can plastic  bottles of water in the rooms be replaced with refillable glass ones? Can the shampoo, shower gel plastic bottles be replaced with all in one solid bars?. The only snacks available outside of mealtimes were small wrapped sandwiches from an outside bar. This is ok for me but at other “all inclusive resorts” snack options have been more widely available"

Very few typical dishes. No flavor. 2- Some rare labels indicate the name of the dish but no description and no mention of allergen   3-One serving spoon for 4 or 5 dishes (never seen anything like it) 4-Breakfast eggs broken from the ledge of the worktop and the same bowl used indefinitely whatever the preparation requested by the guests... it is sure that the hygiene inspectors would make it a discomfort 5-European desserts: pass your way from these pastries with various and varied mousses that come straight out of the freezer (as proof: ice cream still present). For fruit it will be apple, orange, sometimes some melon and some dates  6-Italian restaurant: cold pasta, restrictions has a starter and a dish while the menu offers two courses. The servers are unprofessional and unseemly.  Thalasso (independent of the hotel): the first prize of a chaotic medieval organization. The unanswered question: How do they do it when it’s high season  1-No digitized schedule. The cloakroom rewrites everything by hand on a carbon notebook!!! There is no indication that caregivers know who to care for. Ten people will march in front of you saying “it’s not me, it’s my colleague”. You hear the same refrain all day long. 2-No signage in the building. No one understands how this organization works. You ask your way and you get very little answer. 3-The people at the reception are hateful. Same for the locker room 4-First day: there is no towel. Next days: towels and bathrobes are damp: are they well cleaned between each client?? 5-big doubt about changing and/or cleaning massage tables between each client. The pinnacle being the hammam/scrub room: what about the glove change between each client? What is certain is that the plastic support is not changed. The speaker is brutal and unpleasant 6- in doubt I did not venture to go to the hot tubs and other jacuzzis  Please note that the hotel will not inform you about the start of treatments. Late arrivals could not access the building in Thalasso. They discovered that the treatments had been scheduled the morning after their arrival. BIO AZUR did not want to change the schedules: lost care. Similarly if you request a change of schedule during your stay they will be refused"

What seperates this hotel to others is the view, the best in Hammamet I was informed by our waiter around the pool Skander. what a lovely young man, nothing was any trouble and he was insulted if I went to the bar as he wanted to serve us poolside. The drinks are all served in glasses which is a nice touch, rather than plastic cups which other all inclusive hotels have normally presented us with. The pool area - impeccable, so well designed, you do not feel on top of anyone and lots of shaded areas if required. Lots of beds, very comfortable beds but in the morning these can be very wet as they are hosed down every morning, these do dry out quite quick though. Now the food - fantastic buffet restaurant with lots of choice, all fresh and something for everyone, we always straight to the grill section with fresh fish, meat etc. The pizzas were also very good. All in all amazing people, lovely hotel and an amazing holiday,  Thank you to all the staff at Royal Azur!!"

The terrace in front of the rooms sends back the heat and the air conditioning is not functional until May! An oven! The restaurant is nothing exceptional except the morning Tunisian honey cakes: excellent! As for the waiters, both restaurants and bars, it would be nice to reform them to the reception of all customers. The beach is nice and the sea a translucent blue-green. For me, a 5-star rating, even by local standards, should anticipate the needs of customers."

The masseuse who sleeps on you and who dares to ask you if you liked it, it’s making fun of people’s heads, the exorbitant prices for everything, we are considered cash cows, we can do nothing, knowing that the average salary is 350 euros per month there, the restaurant a lot of smoke, smell of snuff and many people have been sick, vomiting temperature diarrhea flatulence, the animators only a few are very invested if not the others it’s the hunt for the young beautiful and easy where very old but rich to leave the country, alcohol sex disco chew money, there are many problems in this hotel, nothing serious early on.

The hotel has 3 swimming pools, 1 of which is covered.  All-day activities are planned by facilitators who are not insistent. Quality evenings with superb shows  Music a little loud indoors.   The buffet is varied and of very good quality from morning to night.  The all inclusive is respected.  The room is clean and enough for a stay. However if your stay falls or the air conditioning is not activated in the room good courage, because even if there is strong heat June is June!   If you are looking for small activities watch out for the scammer  I would not recommend the shop inside the hotel at all.  But if you are looking for a place to be pampered at resonable prices compare to the hotel, walk 10min on the beach and you will find a hotel with a spa “at momo” you will not be disappointed.   I recommend and will be back."

After a renovation it could be spectacular, but for now it’s the best choice in the area, of the bigger hotels. The staff are doing a great job; Madame Azza and Monsieur Houcine in particular - very friendly and doing everything they can to bring the restaurant to life. Enjoy!"

Majid at the front desk was incredibly helpful and courteous, making the check-in process smooth and pleasant. I also want to highlight Wafa from the Guest Relations team—she was always smiling and radiated warmth throughout my stay.  The hotel itself is beautiful and well-maintained, with great facilities and a relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Sousse. I’m definitely looking forward to returning!"

We spent every day at the large pool area where Taemar organised our sunning spot every morning and the bar staff looked after us all day 🍻🍷☕💯.  The Restaurant Staff were just amazing and the food was good and plentiful.  Our last night was pretty special as our table had been decorated with silk runner and rose 🌹 petals.  A special mention goes to Fathi for going above and beyond and Ammar for his smiley 😊 face at breakfast.  All in all one of the best holidays we have been on.

Food is excellent, and the restaurant staff and chefs are second to none. The bars are always attended so you can always get your drinks, they even go and bring them to you. Now the entertainment, there are 3 of them, Massimo who is in charge then Momoo, and not forgetting the lovely Rania all three of them start really early and finish late and in that time they offer a full programme they include everyone, you can do as much as you like or as little, but you will always see them around smiling. The pool areas are immaculate and staffed by at least 2 lifeguards so little ones can feel safe, pools are 1.5 metres, there is a heated indoor pool sauna steam room and a intensive package should you require massages of all types. The hotel is very secure with 24hour security always present and you can always feel safe. I would have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this hotel to anyone as you will not be disappointed. I cannot wait to return early in June of this year to see all my friends we made whilst in the hotel. 5* in all departments  Our room was 402"

But in fact we don’t care because the little things to improve are caught up by the kindness of all the hotel staff, special mention for the waiters and animators who are of an incredible kindness, and the little care of the children! I find that value for money , there is nothing to blame! The buffet is fine. We may come back;-)  JANIN THIVOS family Justine/ Yoann , Tom and Leo"

        "review_text": "Customer service at Golden Tulip President Hammamet and customer care was sadly lacking  unfortunately. Everyone remembers how you treat them and the women staff at the reception, for example Wiem was so so un helpful for simple enquiry, there was almost a fear to actually go to the receptionist for help or support because of thier disinterest in actually helping. They continue conversation with local language speakers and avoided eye contacted each time you approached them. For simple requests, we booked a family room with a sea view.but was put in a bungalow far away from the hotel, with stairs with a baby/ a push chair, each time It rained It was sliperey, so imagine having to carry that up and down the stairs. This room also had no WiFi access, Eventually after asking again and again and again, we got moved, to a different room, although this was not the sea view room we paid for. The experience at this hotel was just unfortunate as we've previously had a great experience with other staff at a different hotel in Tunisia. Some of the staff in the kitchen were helpful. The food was okay, however, management/leadership at the hotel would benefit from ups killing their staff on customers care and better service."

        "review_text": "Hotels is lovely as are its staff especially the night time bar staff in the indoor bar (I did have their names on a piece of paper at my request however this has now been through the wash 😟) our room was beautiful and specious with a lovely view, we were all inclusive so min bar topped up daily in the room. We would have struggled if we were half board like a lot of the guests as there isn’t anything near the hotel. On check in our room wasn’t ready but the guy handling our check in was polite and friendly and we were able to access all of the facilities whilst we waited. Pool and garden areas were clean and well maintained, the pool bar opened whilst we were there which made getting drinks in the day time easier as prior to this we had to get dressed and walk to the inside bar (a minor inconvenience) The beach for the hotel is lovely however the beach bar was not open during our stay) the food was fresh and lovely and the staff were happy to make things fresh. The spa is definitely worth a visit and not expensive if you book a package as these work out much cheeper. We had a hammam, soap scrub the lady which did this was fantastic she sang and chatted to us throughout and was so lovely, we then had massages it cost less the £80 for the 2 of us.This is out of the control of the hotel but the surrounding area is scruffy,  the beaches were disgusting, full of litter and on our walk to the new town we passed a dead turtle which had clearly been there a while 😖 our visit to the old town wasn’t much better and I would only recommend this if you liked to be hassled and dragged around by people constantly. We visit lots of Arabic countries and have been to Tunisia historically but we felt unsafe and uneasy leaving our hotel so wouldn’t recommend. The hotel is perfect for a relaxing, don’t leave the hotel all inclusive week"

There is a shop on site to cater for all your needs and for anyone wanting a spot of pampering there is a beauty salon as well as Turkish baths. I used the gym several times and did classes with the fitness instructor at the hotel. Special thanks to Daly, who was very professional and gave me some excellent advice on exercises to do at home.  Oceana is a decent hotel to relax,  unwind and escape to. Thank you to all the staff who made my stay an enjoyable one!"

So much so that this is the 1st holiday we have ever been on that we plan to rebook again (for a similar time next year) as soon as we get home!!   The hotel, our room (pool and sea view) and the grounds were all beautiful and very clean.   All the staff are super friendly and efficient. A very high standard of customer service from everyone who works here. The room was exactly like the pictures, on the booking site...very clean and spacious and the bed & pillows were very comfortable. The hotel location is great! Right on a beautiful beach, in a peaceful location.  Jasmine Hammemet is walkable, or a short and cheap taxi away.  Old town Hammemey was not walkable but the taxi fare is still only around £3 to £4 each way.  There were lots of people we met that were returning.  One couple were back for a 33rd visit!  I almost didn't want to leave a review in case it ruins our next experience because of becoming too popular!! Overall a holiday that exceeded our expectations and I can see us visiting many more times in the future. Thank you to everyone at the hotel for a wonderful holiday x"

        "review_text": "Second time at Oceana, we loved it as much as the first. The hotel is always clean, the rooms are spacious and comfortable and the grounds are immaculate. We prefer to visit out of season for the quiet but obviously don't get to experience everything on offer as it's pre-season.  Only minor issue we had was a large conference event shortly after arrival. This is quite off-putting for guests as the conference attendees take over the restaurant and consume everything. Another guest has addressed this, so I'm not going to go over old ground.   There is also a guy in the hotel, I won't name him as he is there legitimately, but he hangs about the toilets, trying to organise  trips into Hammamet, amongst other things. Strikes me a snake oil salesman, but if I want something, I'll ask. I don't want to feel like I need to find alternative toilets to avoid him.  Every single member of the Oceana team go above and beyond, and they will always find a way to assist, even if you don't understand each other. They will find a way. Special nod to Bashir in the restaurant, the morning chef (sorry, I didn't get your name), Ramy at poolside, and Fatima in housekeeping. So many more who's names I didn't catch.  Can't wait to go back again."

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is lovely, and the staff are truly outstanding — they go above and beyond. One evening, my daughter, who’s quite a picky eater, didn’t like anything at the buffet. The chef noticed, and without hesitation, went to the kitchen and made her some pasta just for her. That kind of service really stood out.  There are a few downsides. The hotel is showing some signs of wear, particularly in the carpets, bathrooms, and some of the seating in the restaurant, which could use updating. We stayed in a spacious suite with a sea view, and the beds were incredibly comfortable. However, the air-conditioning wasn’t on, which made it hard to sleep. I requested a fan, but it never arrived — disappointing, especially from a 5-star hotel at the price we paid.  One thing to note: the hotel hosts a lot of conferences, and this really should be mentioned during booking. Tourists were definitely in the minority during our stay. The conference groups completely took over the restaurant. Some were quite rude and acted with a sense of entitlement, showing little regard for paying guests — something that should be better managed by the hotel.  The food was okay, but perhaps not to our taste. We weren’t expecting sausage and peppers or boiled potatoes for breakfast, for example. Not a complaint, just an observation. There were no snacks available between meals, aside from a plate of crisps at the bar, which felt lacking for an all-inclusive package — especially considering the price.  We also visited the marina one evening, but unfortunately, it wasn’t a great experience. It felt run-down, with many shops closed and the area quite dirty — though perhaps it’s better in the summer months. Also, be prepared to be firm with the local street sellers.  All in all, a mixed experience: excellent staff and spacious rooms, but let down by a few avoidable issues that could really elevate the stay if addressed."

The hotel occupancy was low, never more than 30 guests, which worried me at first as I thought I might get bored, but I soon got used to the tranquility and quiet. Staff were fantastic, especially Sameh on reception, who upgraded me to a sea view room at check in. There are no animation/entertainment team at the hotel, which was a first for me, had a couple of treatments at the spa which were inexpensive, good choice of food everyday and chilled evening entertainment.  Glad I paid that little bit extra for the all inclusive as I was drinking Jonnie Walker red label whisky every night, also included was Gordon's gin and other premium spirits. Had a relaxing week and would highly reccomend Oceana, I will be returning."

Reception staff were welcoming, attentive and polite.  I was shown to my junior suite, which was spacious and clean.  But there were some details in the room that needed attention such as the shower, where the water cascaded through the shower door onto the bathroom floor and the shower head where the small outlets needed a good clean so that they all worked and directed downward.  I had a massage during my stay which was great and good value for money, although not the massage I asked for, but I think that was a language barrier.   Restaurant food and its staff were amazing. They remember your name, where you like to sit, what you like to drink. Food was varied, fresh and well presented.  Cons: There were children staying at the hotel, but when I had booked this, it was advertised as an adult only hotel. Finally,  as a solo female traveller, i occasionally felt uncomfortable with the level of attention from some of the male staff."

Drinks and food where at a very good quality, mainly Fish, Lamb & Chicken dishes, the red wine was severed by the glass , 1/2 or full bottle great deserts.  a walk to the Marina down from the private beach is do-able (20mins). would recommend this hotel especially if you just want to chill with the option the take the Taxi to the market in Hammamet ( 15 - 20 Dina). we also had the Spa treatment at the hotel which was excellent, Sonia I think was her name who sang and was very good with the start of our treatment. we also had a free Al-a-cart meal included in our stay which was really nice with a higher spec of meal & wine. CONS - exchanged money has restrictions so don't take any out of the country, defo eat before you get to the airport as the only place open was a baguette and burger place which was £12 for a burger and chips... a sandwich shop and shop selling bags before you go past passport control is the only place you can spend Dina."

Among the great advantages is its central position with the possibility to walk quietly through the port (Marina) even in the late evening.   Also in line of sight and the main attractions i.e. Ribat and the Bugriba Mausoleum. Very high quality and good food for breakfasts, lunches and dinners with strawberries and shrimp. A pleasant and colorful building of the hotel itself.  Animation by physical activity is qualitative and varied. True, there's no gym but it's not noticeable. Rooms are clean, quiet and well cleaned. There is a children's club and a small playground, but the girl in charge of them doesn't like to show up there and a search for her is necessary for its use.  It's a nice impression overall."

The Regency Monastir hotel really surprised me with the quality of its service, its warm atmosphere and especially its exceptional entertainment team. A big bravo to the Fram team, especially Wadja, Firas, Djoe and Chef Rayan, who made each moment unique. Their energy, kindness and professionalism made all the difference. Thank you for these unforgettable memories, I will return without hesitation!"

We also enjoyed the massage spa really well 👍  Team of top animators 👍 Willy, Barbie and Jawad the best. I recommend. Nelly et Eric"

The waiters at the restaurant are super friendly also, the food is very good and varied. The rooms are quite old but clean, the bedding is perhaps to be reviewed. The location of the hotel is ideal because 5 minutes from the city center, I recommend Fram outings with the animators, it is very interesting. The pool bar is not open with regret. At the interior bar, space not reserved for hotel guests and I regret that the service is less neat for guests in all exclusive. Sometimes we walk past you four times without looking at you and we serve you cocktails that have nothing to do with what you asked for, it's a little sloppy. In terms of security I find it is borderline, the outdoor gates access beach are smashed, so everyone goes back access to the pool and the hotel. The more non-hotel guests at the bar, it's open bar, the more smoking in a part of the bar. Otherwise, I recommend treatments and massages at the spa, they are all very gifted and kind."

        "review_text": "My sister and I stayed at the Carlton Hotel in Tunis the night of April 12/13. Last night of a tour of Tunisia perfectly organized by a local tour operator. We were received at the reception by Mr. Lofti.  I'm not lying about staying at the reception for an hour. Mr. Lofti could not find the reservation. Once found, he couldn't find the payment. Once found, we asked for a basket for breakfast the next day that we had paid for but that, following the anticipation of the departure of the plane, we could not take.  Nothing. Don't move, don't pay attention. Nothing. Then we asked for an additional room. Mr. Lofti, angry and again, not available at all, replies that no room was available. On the site, however, there were still some. Let's move on to the bedroom... Mr. Lofti increasingly rude and pissed off (I didn't understand why...) gave us a nice surprise. A room that wasn't one. It was probably the staff room. The air conditioning did not work, the room and the bathroom were outdated.  Mr. Lofti was unpleasant, showed a cruel lack of professionalism. I wish future customers not to run into this person. A hotel that wants to be of a certain standard, should be careful about the choices of its staff."

No welcome products just liquid soap.  The TV will run for a while then I will call a technician who will repair, then it will go back down again I will wait for another technician, and I will warn the reception that this is all not working I am leaving. The smoke detector lamp remains lit red while you sleep, the technician informs me that this is normal.  Anyway fortunately I only booked 3 nights, and the rest of the week I will go elsewhere.  Personally, I don't go back to it, it's up to you."

        "review_text": "Introduction: this was the last overnight stay in Tunisia. Room booked and paid for by the tour operator who organized the trip for me and my sister, always relying on good hotels.  Lofti, the receptionist, claimed that the payment had not been made: he made us wait an hour before giving us confirmation. We asked for an additional room and also for this reason he made us wait, according to him to confront the commercial office! We took the opportunity to grab a sandwich at a bar just outside the hotel. When we returned, the additional room had been sold moments earlier and we were told that the hotel was fully booked (which is not true as there were 5 rooms available online).  The reservation included breakfast at a cost of 10 euros per person, which is no small thing in Tunisia. Since our flight had been brought forward, we could not use it: since the refund seemed not to be possible, we asked for a doggy bag, and we were denied that too. Later, however, the usher knocked on our room saying that he could take care of it, obviously for a fee.... When we saw the room, we were shocked: it is the worst in the structure, as confirmed by people who work in the hotel (n.242): window that opens onto a closed atrium, therefore completely useless, non-working air conditioning with a rather high temperature inside, an iron column near the bed that holds structural beams, definitely dangerous especially at night in the dark, very old bathroom (I do not go into details) whose only opening is only for the inspection of the pipes, noisy ventilation that operates itself even when the light is off and there is no way to interrupt it. In short, a disaster on all fronts! We have not understood the reason for such a relentlessness towards us; perhaps because we are Italian women? The technical director of the tour operator we relied on also intervened but even he could not achieve anything. We tried to speak to a hotel manager but this was not possible either. To sum up, the receptionist proved absolutely incorrect. The next morning his colleague tried to defend him saying that he is new in the trade: assuming that this is true, it is not justified a similar behavior; in any case, the management all this where is???"

Roasted parts make a disgusting impression. Faucet as well as shower faucet worn and calcified. TV has hardly any German/English channels and no connection with Netflix or other apps possible. In the standard rooms there is no kettle - only the newly renovated rooms have one according to the reception. Apparently, there is an additional distinction between what the 3-star category includes for standard rooms and what applies to the “better” renovated rooms. Bad policies and message to guests.  Door lock is so unstable and broken that you are worried about your own safety and the safety of your belongings. Standard room rather disappointing and sad. There are better accommodations in this price range. Would not recommend it for longer stays. There was a bunch of mosquitoes in the room that were bothering at night. Staff is not interested in helping you and does not respond to the criticism, only after renewed demand we would be moved to other rooms but insects/mosquitoes remained a problem! The staff should have solved the insect problem and prepared the rooms better before the guests arrived. We barely slept. In addition, it is very loud, you can hear every door that is closed and every movement on the corridor. Bring earplugs! Door lock is so of unstable and broken, one has concerns about one's own safety and property. Standard room rather disappointing and sad. There's better for the money. Would not recommend it for longer stays!  The only plus is the location, really central and city center within walking distance."

I had a balcony overlooking the park (spectacular view).  Although the noise the ostriches make at dawn are a bit disconcerting at first.  The down side is that the hotel is not being maintained well:  lights out in the bathroom, the buttons for the elevator were so worn it could take five minutes to get them to light up, etc.    All of this were minor inconveniences.  However, the hotel advertises Wifi which worked well the first day I was there.  The second day it went down and there was no wifi available by the  time I left.  The front desk's attitude was \"what do you want me to do about it?\"  I complained several times but got shrugs in response.    Bottom line:  It is an inexpensive, clean hotel but don't expect any support from the front desk."

After all, the hotel offers a very attractive rate in a nice location in the amazing city. But three things I found very unprofessional.  1. Wake-up calls never came. 2. The reception insisted to keep my passport for \"administrative work.\" Half a day later, I found my passport at the reception unattended within the reach of anyone who walked by. I found a staff and asked him if I could have my passport back. All he said was \"Feel free.\" 3. In the morning of checkout, the lady at the reception refused to take a credit card. My booking accepted CC payment, so I said so. She now said something was wrong with the CC reader and told me to wait for an hour. The hotel knew I was checking out in the morning, but there was no prior warning about the machine trouble. I asked her for alternative options, but she only kept saying \"You have to wait for an hour.\" Not until I raised my voice and explained to her (for third or fourth time) that I had a plane to catch when another staff at the reception went into the backroom, looking very annoyed, to fetch the non-electric CC reader to process my payment.  An average 15 year old would have been more thoughtful and helpful.  Totally and incredibly irresponsible, unwilling and incapable staff at the reception."

        "review_text": "I'll try to write objectively, so that the built up frustration doesn't bias things:  -Front desk staff is lukewarm at best in terms of greeting guests and helping them.  I showed up and had to get the gentleman's attention to help check me in.  He asked for my name and passport, took my passport, gave me a key, and told me to go to the room.  Not flat-out rude, but certainly not welcoming.  The doorman had been sitting inside, so he carried my bag from the front door to the elevator (20 ft), then to my room.  He set it down and stood looking at me, waiting by the window.  I assumed he wanted his tip, so I told him I only had large bills and would give it to him later.  He offered to get change, then came back with the bill only split in two...and stood at the door expecting me to give him a tip more than double what I would give a waiter for a full dinner here...no further assistance or greeting from him over the following week's stay. -The hotel is generally very dark. Rooms have *enough* light, but the hallways and lobby are very dark at night. Stairwells literally have no lights. Not sure if this is for eco friendliness or something else, but it's odd. -If you have any issue with indoor smoke, the lobby area and restaurant can be difficult. My colleague also mentioned that cigarette smoke was leaking into her room from a lower floor. -The room key cards randomly stop working. Currently listening to a neighbor repeatedly try his key card (going on 20 minutes) and banging on the door (or trying to break the doorknob?) in frustration (at midnight). This was easily fixed at the front desk for me, but apparently things are different at night. -The front desk credit card machine was down when my colleague tried to check out. -The mini fridge is in the wardrobe. It works fine just the same, but takes up half of the space. -Breakfast may be the most positive experience: plenty of options, and pretty good food. It's a little greasy, and the staff clearly don't enjoy being there, but it's better than average. -We asked at the front desk about dinner and were told that the buffet costs 40 Dinars (after waiting 10 minutes for them to figure this out). We didn't eat dinner here. A large bottle of water from the lobby bar costs 2 Dinar, versus .5-.6 at the shop on the corner. The man who runs this shop is very nice, and it's a good place to stop for snacks. -The walls are paper thin, so you can hear anything that goes on next door, in the hall, or outside. Flushing my toilet means 5 minutes of screaming pipes. A mysterious droning whistle sound comes from outside on the street every half hour or so. -The wireless internet is decent, but the signal was sometimes unreliable even though no room is more than 15-20 feet from a router in the hallway. -Beds are nice, and almost make up for the intermittent noises from elsewhere.  If you won't be around it much, this hotel is serviceable. The staff don't really care that you're here, and they don't do much to improve your stay inside or outside the hotel. You're basically paying for 1) a bed and 2) food in the morning. The experience between Ambassadeur and Hotel Belvedere (around the corner) is night and day, for basically the same price."

Thanks to Wassem in the restaurant, Hamed in the bar, Rabby at the pool bar and Hana from the kids club, even though we didn’t have children with us she came and chatted. There was a huge choice of food with cooking stations as well as help yourself. We had a fantastic 2 hour spa experience. Everywhere was spotless with cleaning going on all the time. Yes, the entertainment was more geared towards the French but we just did our own thing. The staff love to be tipped but we never felt pressured to tip. The beach was a disappointment with plastic bottles and rubbish and I would advise not leaving young girls on their own as the locals would turn up and just stare. But as far as the hotel and complex were concerned, we couldn’t have asked for a more relaxing holiday, thank you."

Can do with a bit of updating. If u like entertainment, u will like it. Some of it can be catered for again non English tourists. There's security as u come into the hotel as well as the hotel beach area.   Advice i will highly recommend bringing mosquito plug in, spray etc. We all got bitten plenty of time. Always have change with you as people love being tipped. Once you go past the hotel beach area you will be very disappointed. As i saw so much rubbish and dead coral, seaweed everywhere. I was very saddened to see this, the beach is being neglected."

We don’t usually use the mini club facilities but after hearing how welcoming the staff were, we sent the kids there for a couple of hours on two days- they all loved it, particularly thanks to Hanna. We would also like to thank Khaled the porter, Sassi the waiter, Adel and Mohammad in reception who all regularly went out of their way to be of assistance.   Top tip if you’re a family of 5 with kids- it may work out cheaper and more convenient, to get the hotel to organise a day trip to Tunis/ Carthage/ Sidi Bou Said than to go with a group tour."

On the spot, however, it turned out that:   The hotel was supposedly taken over by Iberostar, but honestly: you don't notice. It does not seem modernized or professionally managed.  The first impression was already negative, and unfortunately it did not get any better. From the shower came an unpleasant smell that spread throughout the room. The air conditioning was noisy, indicated 30 degrees, but it was still freezing cold in the room – we had to sleep with thick jackets  At the entrance is only “Mirage Hotel”, there is no Iberostar branding.The services and condition of the hotel correspond to a maximum of 4 stars: unpleasant smell in the room and cold, loud and faulty climate hot system, weak Wi-Fi in the room, and no reception in the restaurant or at the stand no service on the beach nu old lying chairs no longer, (all closed ). Because of these massive shortcomings, we have the last two nieces   leave the hotel earlier at your own expense and book a new real 5 star hotel.  In our view, these circumstances are a clear deception – both in terms of hotel classification and services provided. This hotel does not deserve the name Iberostar – at most mid-range. I definitely cannot recommend it."

The food is fresh, well-thought-out, and genuinely interesting — a pleasure to eat every day. The interiors are modern, and the entire layout of the resort, including the pools, is very well-designed. There are pools for every age group: a shallow one for young children (40 cm), a mid-depth option (80 cm), and a deep pool reaching up to 2 meters.  We were given a room that feels more like a private bungalow, which was a wonderful surprise. The room was spotlessly clean, just like the rest of the resort — everything is extremely well-maintained and tidy. The dining area is also very clean, and I was impressed to find no flies at all, dead or alive.  The layout of the entire place is perfect, making it a pleasure to move from one spot to another. The staff are kind, professional, and genuinely welcoming. I haven’t encountered a single hint of unprofessionalism — honestly, I don’t even get this kind of warm welcome in my own family home! It’s truly heartwarming.  I've been here for nearly a week now, and usually by this point in other hotels, I’d have spotted at least a few flaws. Not this time — everything has been excellent."

My wife is a vegetarian and was told that she was eating vegetarian fritters only to realise after taking a bite it was actually chicken even though the label said vegetable fritters. She was very sick. I have a severe fish allergy,  meat was being cooked on the same griddle so I struggled to eat the food. We both didn't trust anything.  We were supposed to be having a la carte meal, only to be told they were fully booked. We spent a fortune eating out. The beach bar and both beach restaurants were shut so we were very disappointed. The beach was littered in rubbish and you get constantly hassled by locals trying to sell you something. All entertainment etc is in french. Some of the staff are lovely, very overworked but still smile. They made our holiday but it was just not the romantic honeymoon we thought we'd get."

However, in reality it looks different with regard to sandy beach etws because there are actually only 2 rows of loungers there and not as many loungers as on the picture because the sea level goes much further out. The service on the beach was mixed. If you are close to the restaurant you get towels and are served courteously than if you are further away. Beach and sea were clean. Dinner problem here were the flies that gladly helped themselves to the dessert."

I stayed with my family and they have all said the same as I have. From arrival the staff are possibly the most friendly staff I have ever met. We were worried before we arrived about our children eating here but there was not a single meal time we struggled to feed them. The staff in the restaurant could not do enough for us and made our children feel so special every single meal time.  The bar staff are amazing and were always smiling, we finished one drink as another was given to us. The bar man in the pool bar called mamoud always had a smile and always having a laugh with us.  The cleaners were amazing our room was spotless every day and also left us surprises most days such as swans and flowers made from the towels.   Finally marhaba beach has definitely got the best animation team I have ever experienced.  Sarah is amazing with the kids every day. Momo khaled , Amin , looka, Ben , Sam and DJ monta were the happiest people in the place from morning till night , with great activities and shows on the evening.  And the foam pool party was something special   They have truely made this holiday special for us all   Thank you so much"

I sat in and watch at how the mother was treated, she was in tears as they stated her child did things she wishes he could.  Blackmailed her too! Avoid if you have a child with needs or one who like to splash"

My children were so happy to see Looka on our return they’re very fond of her from our last visit  We also would like to mention the following staff who just make the visit extra special each time we come Looka/sarah kids adore them  Mokhtar Dhifli best waiter always attentive Everytime we have visited he treats us like royalty and my children love him like an uncle Mahmoud runs the pool bar always busy making guests happy with a smile on his face and keeps things running smoothly always Whenever we arrive we always visit  Shout out to anis the poolman for keeping the kids safe even if he does wear that shocking man united hat Lool jawhwrhan or as my kids call him the fish man as they love to have a fish pedi which makes them giggle & laugh Naima our cleaner we were so happy to see her she loves my children we adore her.

        "review_text": "We have just come back  from Shems,  we travelled as a large family of 9 children range from 10 to 22, but I can honestly say that the hotel catered for everyone and kept us all busy because it is the staff who make this place what it is most specially the animation team !!... the hotel is clean and pool areas really nice. The aqua park is fab and kids and adults all loved the slides ! The food is actually really really good and varied, however if you have fussy little ones who will only eat nuggets then you will struggle ( they do have pizza every meal and fries every lunch time. Pasta is also available,) The animation team were absolutely fabulous- we are a large family with big characters, but they embraced our craziness and joined in our mad games, they made an effort with every single one of the kids and really made our holiday !!! Thankyou Zico, Ash,James Alfa, and mazi. ( sorry for the names we forgot ) The bar staff were all super they even found F1 for my partner on the big screen !!( apologises can't remember all names !)  On our first day  Med Saleh served us and he told us it was his first day, but he looked after us all week bringing drinks to the pool and chatting- Shems made a good choice employing him !. Now for the very few negatives, the bungalows are basic, clean and for what you pay good and perfect for two people, however we had a 'family room '( same bungalow as a double room with two single camp beds in ) fine I guess for toddlers but we had a 17 year old, 10 year old and myself and my partner, not ideal that there is no door between  bedroom part and lounge part so  no where to change, no privacy, couldn't even change behind an open wardrobe door as they have holes in 🤣🤣they are too small for parents with older children !. My only other moan would be certain parts need some TLC like the aqua park toilets. Overall we had an amazing holiday with very lovely staff who really cared and looked after us all week. This was a cheap holiday, it was 5 star for staff and pools, the rooms are not. It is value for money - thanks shems for a super week !!"

The food is always good and I challenge anybody to not find something that they like.  The staff could not be more friendly if they tried and the Animation team have definitely been stepped up a level this year by Zico. Accommodation is always clean and rooms are cleaned towels/ sheets changed daily.  My only complaint on this visit is the bar. They appear to have new bar management and it's not for the better. I can say with 99% certainty that the vodka is watered down and I'm pretty sure the whiskey is too.  This is not a good move for Shems and needs sorting before people start booking other hotels, as I will be."

The staff are wonderful, particularly at Reception, the main restaurant and the bar. The swimming pools are lovely - we mostly used the main pool away from the hotel lobby.  The beach was wasnt quite open but looks good, The beach is dirty however this isnt the Hotels fault. Food was a bit limited for choice after a week. Our grand daughter struggled a bit but the pool snack bar was great and we used that a few times. We had italian at the sister hotel and I have to say that was poor. Our apartment was fine but the aircon didnt work and the kitchen area was poorly equipped. Shower water pressure was also not good. Location within the complex was lovely though. All in all, this Hotel was very nice and definitely worth a visit. For all its faults I would recommend it."

        "review_text": "I booked to go to this hotel last year and it did not disappoint me. I was travelling solo to Tunisia and to be honest I was slightly anxious. When the coach pulled up at the Hotel Diar Lemdina I was delighted to see how beautiful it was, I loved the traditional themed building and it was joined onto the Medina.  A man came out and took all of my luggage to the reception whilst I checked in, I was slightly early for check in and my room wasn't quite ready so the staff told me to go to the restaurant and get something to eat and drink! The staff where awesome. When I explained that I was on my own the staff made an extra effort and made sure that I was okay throughout my 10 night stay here.   I chose to use the adult pool throughout my visit which was always quiet and well maintained, the life guards were so helpful when I needed assistance getting my sun bed out and putting up the umbrella.  There was always something going on throughout the day at the other pools and the animation team were always on hand to inform me of what activities were on that day.   The evening entertainment was very good also, the hotel staff were friendly and upbeat, I was quite happy having my dinner at night and going for a walk through the beautiful Medina which is joined onto the hotel then heading back to my room.   I went on an all inclusive basis and the food never disappointed, especially the breakfast's, everything was fresh, a terrific selection of food, I was impressed with the omelette making section and the crepe service, syrup and Nutella crepes were unreal and the waiting staff again went above and beyond to assist me at mealtimes.   As I was on my own I imagined having a small room with a balcony or terrace but my suite was huge, very roomy, lots of cupboard space, 2 bathrooms, 1 with a bath and a lovely balcony. My towels were changed daily and my bedsheets were changed every second day, most days I came into a beautiful towel design and fresh flowers on top of the bed. The maids were also extremely friendly.   I had a fantastic stay in the Hotel Diar Lemdina. Looking forward to going back with my mum in September."

The hotel is decorated in a traditional Tunisian style and is right in the centre of the tourist medina, as if you were in an Oriental fairy tale.   The location is super: the hotel is on the grounds of Medina - around shops, cafes, entertainment.  The food was generally good. There was a good choice for breakfast, fresh pastries, Tunisian dishes. Lunches and dinners have sometimes seemed monotonous, but you certainly won't stay hungry."

The hotel is beautifully located right on a stunning beach with crystal-clear water — perfect for relaxing and long walks by the sea.  Our room was clean, spacious, and had a lovely balcony with a sea view. Housekeeping was consistent and thorough every day. The food at the buffet was excellent, with a wide variety of options that catered to all tastes. I especially appreciated the delicious local Tunisian dishes.  The pool area was clean and well-maintained, with plenty of sunbeds and a fun atmosphere thanks to the energetic animation team. There were always activities available, but also enough quiet spaces to simply unwind.  Overall, Nour Palace exceeded my expectations. It’s a great destination for both families and couples looking for relaxation, good food, and friendly service. I will definitely be coming back!"

It is impossible to mention them all by name, but each one of them tries their best and takes care of the guests in the best possible way. I could easily leave my son with them and swim at the same time. They are open, speak different languages ​​and always meet the guests' needs. My son had the best relationship with Sarra, but the rest also try very hard. And even when they are tired, they do not show it. I thank them very much for everything. Mouna is also very nice, she takes care of the hotel-guest relationship. The meals are varied. Everyone will find something delicious for themselves. The hotel is not the youngest but it is maintained in really good condition. Rooms are in good shape. The beach is sandy, large swimming pool and great slides. I highly recommend it to all those who are undecided."

        "review_text": "A little bit of disappointment. The hotel is big and right at the sea those are the pluses on which I believe the rating is based on. You can see that there are no investments in this place, all furniture looks very old. The rooms are spacious which is a nice surprise. But to be honest I have chosen Tunisia as from the past experience in other hotels it had the best animations. From the reviews, I saw that animations at this hotel are great but it seems that all has changed in September. I was there at the beginning of the month and hotel seemed in full capacity. But the animation program was very poor. The long list of day activities which was presented on the hotel's wall has nothing to do with the reality.  A few times there was a water polo, the only thing that happened daily was aqua gym. For zumba- we had to ask daily the animation team about it. It is the first time that instead of animation team encouraging guests to take part in activities it was the guests that asked for some of them. Volleyball- it was a ball at animation's booth and again You could go and ask for it, there was no organisation of the plays. Only the animation boss had some energy and really tried.   As for the food it was overall good but some some of the waiters tried to flirt and when turned down started to be rude. Also at some point all salt shakers disappeared. And I would even understand if this was for a half a day for cleaning (still would be a disappointment in 5* hotel) but the situation lasted for a few days. The salt was available at one place of the dining room on the plate... Some people took it in their fingers... simply disgusting. There were no beer kegs at the diner- the beer was placed in plastic water bottles and then from that the waiters poured it down Your glass...  The a'la carte restaurant.... This was even more weird. For all such restaurants in the hotels I went to You choose the dishes from the menu at the table and then they arrived at Your table. In this hotel this is copy and paste from the dining hall. Literally. There is just an open buffet with the same dishes as in the main restaurant. The only difference I saw was tiramissu.   Also watch out at the exchange office. Always check if the amount received is the same as on the paper they gave You. I hope it was simple mistake but I received less, ofc I pointed that out and received total amount but still something like that happened to me for the first time.  Overall if the weather is good and You are looking for the cheap hotel near the sea it is ok. The sea is beautiful with easy access and without rocks. Just a lot of seashells which brings even more beauty to this. Watch out for jellyfishes though.   Sadly this region is quite a long way from all interesting places. You can visit Mahdia but for all the organised tours usually You need to consider whole day out."

Animation team work hard all day around the pool.  For me as solo traveler I found there is nothing to do at night as the shows I felt were pretty child like. Last year I went to a 3 star and they brought in entertainment some evenings which were amazing.  Down sides for me personally was from day 1 constantly being asked by animation team to write review on here and some reviews were written by them.  Food … selection of hot food very poor and repetitive. Plenty salad items on offer. Snack bar only does crepes or pizza . No kids menu here.  In all I enjoyed my stay but would not return as this was my 3rd year in Tunisia and there are better hotels in other parts with more on offer ."

All are in the care of the staff — from the manager to the front desk staff, from the self, to the maintenance.  It is one of the oldest hotels in Monastir, being gradually renovated, which gives it a lot of charm.  Every day, they take the time to ask us what we’ve done — our little excursions and walks ‘in the snatch’ version (zero organization, 100% fun 😂) — and they offer us places to visit that only the locals know. They are very interested in our program and experience.  We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax, feel well surrounded, and have a real and friendly experience. Thank you to the whole team for this great adventure!”  Far from the far too luxurious complexes that lock you up and oppress you. It was our experience and it is authentic.  Thank you 🙏 to them"

The hotel is in a great location, close to the center, shopping, history. I rate the hotel services as 4*. But I would rate the animators as 5*, their positives, their activity is great, they can entertain, take care of your children, and they have a great attitude and service... everyone was very helpful and nice. But I have to highlight the animators once again, they have a great attitude towards all people, for all ages. So we will be back."

        "review_text": "Of all the hotels I have been to, this is by far the worst 4 star by a country mile! From misrepresentation of water slides which are no longer there, to food which is at best, edible. I am not saying that the staff are bad, far from it, they were friendly and helpful, but how can they deliver a great experience when you room smells of sewerage depending on the wind direction, you have to 'shoulder' your balcony door open (three rooms identical) and not be able to lock them? Any gaps in the frames were stuffed with newspaper in an attempt to stop the  draughts. No towel rails to hang your towels on after use. Drains that flow so slow that the water floods the bathroom when taking a shower.Safety was just non existent. No emergency lighting that worked on stairs. When we had a power cut (staff acted like it was a normality and carried on like nothing had happened) visitors using phone torches to use stairs,some dragging thier luggage with them, So unbelievably dangerous. Electrical cupboards unlocked where children could easily access with potential death. I have never, ever been offered ratatouille for breakfast! The meat cuts for lunch and dinner were the cheapest, boniest, fattiest you could possibly buy. I struggled to find something varied to eat. No spoons to eat your desserts (though the desserts were varied and were very nice) Forks provided in the counter to serve yourself olives and sauces( seriously 😳) The music was the same artist daily and no modern day songs. It blasted out all day over the pool area. The coffee machines were switched off in the resteraunt for lunch and dinner...Guess no one wants any after breakfast? The machines in the bar areas did not work properly,  so it was difficult to get a nice hot drink during yhe day. The man at reception was a crook. Trying to stiff everyone  when converting currency.  Acted upset when challenged and reluctantly gave the extra change owed. The wine was undrinkable,  understood it was local, but suitable only for chips.  The beer was watery. If you wanted to buy branded products, they were extortionate. So utterly disappointed with Thomas Cook! Thomas cook apparently owned by  Polish company now, obviously not the trusted brand of years past so please avoid. Currently this hotel is still advertising the water slides which were removed in 2023..... I strongly suggest you avoid unless you are prepared for a 1 star experience, there is no way this could possibly be described as a 4star hotel!"

All the staff are lovely, friendly and kind.   Thank you, the reception team, who honoured my request prior to our visit. The maids kept the room clean to a high standard, gardeners keeping the place beautiful, spa staff thank you for helping me unwind. The animation team is so good, keeping us entertained with lots of fun and energy! Bar staff keeping the drinks flowing, serving with a smile!  Finally, a big shout out to the chefs, especially Hassen and Wassim. You guys work hard! Thank you so much for the delicious meals prepared and keeping us fed for the 10 days and the waiting staff at the restaurant and management. You are appreciated 👏🏼   Keep up the hard work, and we will see you soon! Thank you all  for being part of my daughters holiday memories!"

There were some marvellous watermelon shows at lunchtime. Thank you!  The gardeners maintain the grounds to a high standard. Especially want to mention animators all, Nader, Gustavo, Leo and all other guys (I am sorry, I do not remember all their names).  Many thanks to Aina as the leader of the animation teamю Without them the holiday would be completely different. There is always entertainment in the hotel thanks to the animation team. From yoga, pilates, dancing, darts, volleyball, archery and much more.  I would especially like to note the evening shows and karaoke. We will definitely return to this hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

        "review_text": "We recently stayed at Sentido Bellevue Park Hotel as a couple with a young child, and it was easily one of the best holidays we’ve ever had. From the moment we arrived, the experience was seamless, welcoming, and full of thoughtful touches that made all the difference.  A special and heartfelt thank you to Amine at the front desk, who truly made our stay exceptional. When we first arrived, there was an issue locating our booking, which could have been stressful—but Amine handled everything with such calm professionalism and kindness. Not only did he resolve the issue quickly, but he also upgraded us to a beautiful junior suite, ensuring we were comfortable and happy right from the start.  Throughout our stay, Amine continued to check in on us, always greeting us with a smile and making sure everything was going smoothly. He was incredibly helpful with any questions we had, offered great recommendations, and made us feel genuinely cared for. His warmth, hospitality, and personal attention truly stood out and set a high standard for the rest of the staff. It’s rare to meet someone who takes so much pride in their work—Amine is a real credit to the hotel and played a huge role in making our stay so memorable. Thank you again, Amine—you went above and beyond.  The hotel itself is stunning, spacious, and ideally located right on the beachfront. There’s plenty to do for all ages, and our little one had an absolute blast. The shops inside the hotel were fairly priced, with very friendly shopkeepers, and the Terrace Bar offered a lovely atmosphere where staff would take the time to ask about your day—a nice personal touch.  The animation and entertainment team were also a massive highlight. Full of energy and always engaging, they offered daily activities and fun for both kids and adults. They made a genuine effort to connect with guests, and our child loved them—they made every day exciting and special.  The food was excellent, with plenty of variety, especially for seafood lovers. There were always fresh options for children, plus salads, fruits, meats, and delicious freshly squeezed orange juice every morning. And we have to mention the desserts—they were outstanding! Poolside snacks were also fresh and well-stocked each day.  We really appreciated how attentive the dining staff were, especially when it came to families. Because we had a young child, they always had a highchair ready and waiting for us at each meal. They made dining stress-free and even joyful, with lovely touches like rose petals on the tables, and chefs who always greeted us warmly and checked that we were enjoying our meals.  It’s also worth mentioning that tipping the staff goes a long way. The team works so hard and really appreciates the gesture. We found that a small tip was met with extra attentiveness and kindness—though truthfully, they were already going above and beyond.  Our room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, and the entire hotel was well-maintained and thoughtfully run.  All in all, Sentido Bellevue Park Hotel is a truly fantastic resort. Whether you’re a couple, a family, or traveling solo, this hotel offers a perfect blend of relaxation, fun, and outstanding hospitality. We’re already planning our return—and we’ll definitely be looking out for Amine when we do!"

        "review_text": "I stayed two days solo at the Hotel La Cigale Tabarka. When I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome of the manager, which immediately put me at ease. The environment is superb and the perfect setting to relax. However, I was a little disappointed by the departure: while the manager had greeted me very well on arrival, he did not even greet me when I left, as if my stay had not counted. Too bad, because a little attention or a simple “I hope your stay went well” would have been enough to end on a positive note. Maybe it’s because I didn’t spend a lot on extras (catering, spa...), which cooled the attitude. It’s still a beautiful place, but this little detail left me with a mixed impression."

We enjoyed the gym, the pool, the children's playroom — which is a real plus in this hotel (thank you for thinking about it) — the spa for a massage session, the More cafe, the restaurants... Really, it was great. The hotel is always clean and smells wonderful. It is a very, very nice place.  But the real added value to all this is the staff:  “I’ll start with Soundous, the masseuse who gave me a massage at the ballot boxes. She was very professional, took her time and took care of me. His words are beautiful and sweet. She remained very focused throughout the session. Her massage drew tears from my eyes. I had a great time and I would be so happy to see her again when I come back! THANK YOU SOUNDOUS!!  “Then there was Asma, a charming hostess who knew how to listen and meet my needs:). Her investment touched me a lot, and she was able to rely on her colleagues Oumayma, Aya and Rym, who very quickly showed that a real team existed. Really, a BIG THANK YOU TO YOU GIRLS!!! I also hope to see you again during my next visit.  “And then Afef, the animator of the game room. When they heard that they were going to leave permanently, the children began to cry. All they did was claim Afef throughout the stay. These were happy moments for them, and it did us parents great good. Thank you for your investment, your smile and your sweetness.  It would be a great pleasure to see these people so dedicated to their profession, professional, and who remain attentive to the needs of the customers.  The hotel is beautiful, large, clean, and offers a lot of services, but nothing would be possible without these people worth gold. Thank you for who you are, and for your professionalism.  Cons: the restaurant meals are average, but the breakfast is full and delicious, and the service remains great!  Thank you to the whole team! I highly recommend this hotel!!"

Unfortunately, the staff tries to be a bit more genteel than their most distinguished guests. Since we are quite normal, we would be more happy about a friendly and personal warmth. Compared to other 5 star hotels, such as La Badira in Hammamet, La Cigale lacks a lot. Today we had to recode the room card three times. That's not a bad thing. But that an employee comes to the villa and then tells us to pick up the key at the reception is not worthy of 5 stars. Hotel and facility very good, staff and service unfortunately disappointing. I got to know Tunisian cordiality differently in recent years. I hope I experience that even better in the next two days."

A big congratulations to the kitchen team, who regaled us with delicious dishes, as well as to the service and housekeeping staff, whose impeccable work contributed to our comfort.  Thank you again for this unforgettable experience!"

All the staff we encountered were friendly, highly professional, and clearly well-trained, making our stay even more enjoyable. It’s evident that they are carefully selected for their roles.  Our room was comfortable and luxurious. It was impeccably clean, well-equipped with everything we needed, and offered a stunning view of the golf course.  One evening, we ordered room service, and the food was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. We didn’t have the opportunity to use the spa, but we did enjoy the swimming pool, which was spotlessly clean and maintained at a lovely temperature.  A special mention to Farid at the breakfast and dinner buffets—he was exceptionally attentive and helpful, adding a personal touch to our dining experience.  We would highly recommend and definitely stay again."

        "review_text": "This is the 2nd time we book with family, in this hotel (the 1st time in 02/2022). Between the two visits, the hotel underwent a nice degradation: 1) The hotel seems poorly maintained, quite a lot of wear, imperfections have not been repaired/maintained. Too bad not to take care to keep a certain standing. 2) Wifi does not work, simply, in the rooms (on the 1st). We had to tap and blow up our French 4G packages. 3) The buffet restaurant is not worthy of a 5*. Quite a few stands (grids, etc) are empty, the only new thing is the price which has increased (135 TND for the evening). We revisited the evenings after, same observation. Avoid it. On the other hand, à la carte restaurants (coral and basil), are a better value for money. 4) We recognize a 5* straight away by the quality of the toilet towels that need to be renewed and soft, there they have become dark gray and hard, by passing them by machine, some towels are almost unusable. It's time to change them. 5) Some people at the service are not correct, at the buffet of the BF, a person almost refuses to serve you and he does it with quite a few other customers. Others, when maintaining the room, criticize guests aloud. Finally, we had a mishap, about a request at the restaurant where we were guaranteed a gluten-free product, except that it was not. The after-effects were significant on health and the rest of the stay wasted. It's time to remove a star from this hotel and update it, only to return it later once there's an improvement."

The rooms were luxurious, spotlessly clean and offered a perfect balance between comfort and functionality. I would particularly like to highlight the hotel manager who not only warmly welcomed us, but also made sure that our wishes were fulfilled. He made it easier for us to access the golf courses and provided us with a personal contact person who was always available for our concerns.  The entire hotel complex, from the Thalasso and Spa areas to the golf courses, is in excellent condition and offers an ideal environment for both business and leisure stays.

As we are all vegetarians this was a issue as the all inclusive menu was limited for us.  The first day was difficult but once we managed to speak to the restaurant manager he ensured we would have a vegetarian menu.  This was a lovely hotel to stay in and the staff members were very kind to us. The animation team was wonderful and the night entertainment was one of the best I've experienced in comparison to other countries I've visited. Lovely stay and I managed to do  the parasailing which is based at the private hotel beach. The beach is clean and peaceful with only hotel members. We also booked a few excursions such as pirate ship, quad biking and visited the Santorini style sidi  Bou Said about visit was beautiful through the hotel reception team. Lovely hospitality also used the SPA at the hotel. The hotel is very spacious so lots of walking around. The rooms are Tunisian style traditional detail. Very different to where I have stayed in the past but I loved the traditional stay which added to the experience.. wonderful stay.."

We hope it will not be a disappointment in the summer.   The animation team is the be-all and end-all.   And the animation boss before did it sooooo great !!!

No hairdryer, but you can take it to the reception. Nutrition is varied, you won't stay hungry! The sea, the beach, the pool, everything's great! Terrace and beach bars are open, steak bar is open 24 hours a day. Employees and staff are friendly and very cool guys, to any request immediately reacted and decided when necessary. The hotel has everything you need for a comfortable stay and to restore your physical and emotional health. The atmosphere in the hotel is a separate topic! Great!!!! Everyone who works there creates it, but I want to say something about the animation team. You guys are FIRE!!! Worth only of - for them visit this hotel this season!!!! I work all day, evening and at the pool and the beach... the program has different activities: sports, dance and many, many things, as well as evening programs. Incendiary, friendly, positive, energetic and very beautiful TEAM!!!!! It certainly won't be. Guys, respect for you! You made my rest! Love and hug everyone!

We looked forward to every bite!  Mornings were a treat thanks to the amazing team at the breakfast bar. Amira was an absolute star, kindly keeping our daughter happy with an endless supply of her favorite strawberry juice (we’re still hearing about it!). And Haider deserves a huge thank you for crafting what our son insists were “the best Nutella crepes in the world.” Watching him make them with such care made breakfast feel extra special.  We also want to extend our thanks to Ahmed, who ensured our room was perfect and helped us settle in comfortably. The view of the desert from our room was breathtaking, and everything was spotless – a true reflection of the hotel’s high standards.  May is a great time to go.  It super busy, great weather, and everyone is very attentive.   Thank you, Anantara, for a memorable and relaxing experience. We can’t wait to return!"

Many thanks to all our very friendly Tunisian hosts. But take care of your environment.  What a sadness to see the ambient filth of this beautiful country."

Having previously stayed at Anantara The Palm Dubai and Anantara Al Houara, as well as numerous other locations around the world, I was not expecting the staff and food to be as amazing and delicious as they were. I would like to extend my compliments to the chef for being so kind to us and providing excellent service at Anantara Sahara Tozeur. The atmosphere, hospitality, and overall vibe of the place were also exceptional. Thank you to the chef for creating unforgettable memories for us with such exceptional meals."

Spa is amazing with multiple offerings. Food is amazing and to name one that stands out exceptionally is the Asian restaurant onsite - Mekong. Who knew one can get Asian food in Tunisia that too far removed from Tunis. Breakfast is vast with lots of options."

Access to the various areas is via small cars, which always arrive quickly. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is wonderfully well-appointed, with a wide variety of dishes for both dinner and breakfast. They set up a place to watch the sunset, which was wonderful! Unfortunately, however, the maid's cleaning service left a lot to be desired. They forgot to put on a shower cap, two bath towels and, what made us believe that cleanliness is not the strong point of this beautiful hotel, they didn't straighten the sheets on the bed!"

        "review_text": "The room and cleaning staff have been lovely, but unfortunately the food at the Asian restaurant caused severe food poisoning. I’ve been extremely unwell, vomiting and spending hours in the bathroom, to the point I couldn’t sleep at all. It’s left me feeling anxious about eating anything else during the rest of my stay, which has really impacted the experience.  (We only ate food at the hotel…)  No accountability was taken. The manager said maybe it was an allergy or a sunstroke. Even though I have not been in the sun, because I am not a person who likes to tan at all, I have been drinking consistently water and been in the shade. An allergy would not cause somebody to throw up the entire night and have to spend their whole night on the toilet. The best they could do for me was send a guy to clean up the vomit or offered ‘medication’.   Unfortunately, the overall quality of the food is also quite subpar. In addition to poor customer service."

        "review_text": "I have chosen this hotel because of the spa which I used in the past and liked it a lot. The hotel feels authentic though a bit outdated in some areas with a good service overall.  The people at the restaurant are lovely and serve you well irrespective of whether you tip them or not. I know that it is a big issue in other hotels but not in this one. However, I do recommend leaving some tips as it makes you and the people who provide you with a great service happy.  The food choice was limited but I always managed to have something which I really loved. The hotel had a nice indoor pool as well. My main concern was the constant irritating humming noise which was at the background all the time and it was just impossible to sleep. This noise has something to do with ventilation or old engineering wiring. I spoke to a few other guests and all by one said that they had no any issues with any noise. Though one other guest also reported some noise which was evident when she would go to bed at night. The cleaning and the room itself was wonderful.  All in all  I had really lovely time in this hotel but I have to give it three stars only because of my inability to have a nice sleep there which is extremely important to me when I am on holidays."

        "review_text": "We were very excited by the reviews and the score of the hotel. We booked in TUI for May 16 for 7 days. I'll quote the hotel's good and bad points. Excellent staff strive to serve the guest. Very clean common areas in marble and walls in Arabic style. The best the SPA is luxurious with modern whirlpool chambers, sauna, jacuzzi and other excellent quality services in addition to the staff q attend. The food is varied and the pastry part super. Negative points the standard alcoves are small, the balcony also, no air conditioning, towels and sheets do not change them it is time to ask for the change. The bathroom is medium level no toiletries just a soap and a plastic hat, no makeup mirror, the fridge is very old and poorly located, no coffee maker. The bed has 2 small pillows and does not put a bedcover. This is the worst point. The beach is removed from the hotel, it is time to walk along a path, there is no animation on the beach. Regarding the attention if it is true that there is preference for English customers since they are the majority. We were given some of the worst rooms.  Conclusion hotel with specialty for English, senior citizens in the majority. For us a 3 star hotel no more."

The food was excellent and varied all week, we met the head chef who was lovely and even offered to cook specially for my partner who is gluten intolerant. There were some gluten free options available daily including bread and desserts as well which were kept separate. All of the staff were friendly and polite and the entertainment team were great, engaging but not pushy. Great value for money. We’ll be back."

Rooms are nice and spacious and well maintained with a good sized TV including UK Channels, Fridge and  a bathroom with fresh towels daily and shampoo, soaps etc.  The hotel has a vast range of facilites including a seawater indoor pool, spa and gym (extra cost) and a selection of indoor and outdoor bars, kids club and outdoor snacks. There is also a private hotel beach with a bar a short walk away. All ther staff are amazingly friendly and greet you when they pass. There is a huge shop in the hotel that has all the stuff you might have forgotten to pack plus a big range of local sovineers. Dining here iis amazing, food is top quality and the selection is vast at all meal times. You can choose  to eat in the dining room or the cafe with waiter service or enjoy a paninni from the pool bar. Soft drinks and coffee are branded products like Coca-Cola and Nescafe but the spririts and beer are local varieties, but not bad!  Every day there are lots of activites organised by the animation team including darts, french bowls, water exercise etc. The animation team are amazing and work really hard to encourage guests to have fun on holiday. Special mention for Mr Bean who does the french bowls and he works hard to make everyone feel comfortable whilst playing the games. This is a Tui hotel and it has to be mentioned that they provide supeb support at the hotel and whilst travelling. My first time in Tunisia but I will return as the security is good, people are friendly and the value for money is excellent. Royal Kenz gets a 9/10 from me overall."

Restaurant : Foreigners are greeted with a smile and service without a request, but the yellow wagon holders are the same and the workers are worried about even the tables in terms of adjustment and the quality of the wagon and knives, so that the water is cold for foreigners and hot for yellow wagons."

Both outdoor pools slightly cool,stated heated didn’t feel heated. Room ok beds horrid felt like sleeping on boards.My mains issues were with the drinks,only 1each of local Whiskey.Rum,Gin and Vodka available no other drinks several cocktails not made fresh ,asked for a Bloody Mary but didn’t serve tomato juice once more most 4star hotels would provide these little extras.Second bribe is the glasses no issue with plastic glasses by the pool area but these were small tumblers serving about a third of a pint.In the main area lager served in small half pint glasses again something you would expect in a 3 Star establishment. You could get lager glasses if you asked for them once more you shouldn’t have to ask.My wife visited the Spa and stated it was exceptional she paid 85 Tunsia dnr .In conclusion some aspects suggest a special hotel but overall it’s the minor issues that spoil this hotel ps nighttime entertainment leaves a lot to be desired,for example on bingo night we were charged 20 Tunsia  Dnr (£5)for a sheet of bingo cards ,they must have sold at least 100 three prizes given out for the first game prize T-shirt Prize for second game bag of hotel goodies and for winning the third game a 30 minute massage just not sure what happened to all the money took on the night (2000 Tunsia Dnr (£500) Thus once more does not reflect 4star entertainment Final complaint Tv only 1 English station out of 40+ channels As stated ok hotel but not 4 Star it falters to deceive"

        "review_text": "I just got back from the Royal Kenz not long ago, and i've never written a review before for a hotel but me, my mum, dad, and boyfriend can safely say they have one of the best entertainment teams ever. Especially Mr Bean, who was a great laugh the whole holiday and made it even better. The hotel itself was beautiful, so much to see and all the flowers around it made it one of the prettiest hotels i've been at. The food was good, they always had a hot dessert that you could watch getting made this could've been crepes, or chocolate fondue, or tiramisu. The desserts were a 10/10 everyday and they had plenty of fruit on offer as well that was all fresh and delicious. I really enjoy the fact they had a different theme for the food each night, one night being a \"gala\" theme with plenty of alcoholic and nonalcoholic cocktails for you to take on your way into the restaurant! The only small issue we had was with the rooms, no air conditioning is available until June and the rooms are already roasting by May. So to try combat this we would leave the balcony door open, but that resulted in me having more mosquitoes bites than ever before (and my record is 15). Our toilet was also a bit broken, specifically the button to flush it and sometimes the toilet would just flush itself for ages but that wasn't a big issue. The restaurant staff were great, so nice and by the third day knew what drinks you wanted, same with the bartenders especially the ones working at the pool bar who were wonderful. Overall, I would definitely go back here as it was a great experience made even better by the staff which is the reason I wrote this review, thank you Mr Bean for making our holiday what it was!"

An extra radiator was put in the bathroom to allow us to use it (we usually shower naked 😄). We will not come back again at this time of year, for sure, because our pleasure is wasted... And as the payment of the stay is made upon arrival, impossible to shorten the latter 😒"

        "review_text": "The worst thing for me (if he had a flight home I would probably have interrupted my stay): what some call \"music\", namely a sequence of rare notes without soul, without character, repeated every minute, what I say, every 30 seconds, for hours, every day the same. And impossible to escape, I could hear them from the balcony, in some parts of the park, during breakfast, during treatments... and even at the Moorish cafe! There were only in the \"administrative\" parts, reception for example, where one could escape. It was to the point that I woke up in the morning to hear those notes in my head. For me unbearable. This music seems to be a problem for the staff: during the treatment, when I asked to turn off the speaker in the room to hear only what was coming from the hallway, the person concerned would tell me either that he had not heard these sounds, or harsher words like \"it breaks my head\" (sic).  There are also some shortcomings on the part of the staff, shortcomings are difficult to understand in a hotel of this category, in particular: •\tpersonnel who walk into the room at great strides without announcing themselves, which happened 3 times while I was in the room and which must have happened also in my absence. You can imagine the embarrassment of being half naked in front of a lady. •\tat the reception, where requests are properly received, but without more, followed by broken promises, twice out of three; an example: since my robe has been removed without being replaced and there is no cleaning lady in the corridors, the reception, to which I have indicated that I will have treatment in less than an hour, told me that the necessary action will be taken immediately. Now 10 minutes before the treatment, nothing; I then decided to go around the building, finally coming across a charming person who helped me. When I returned from the care, there was still no bathrobe...  •\tat breakfast the services are systematically removed as soon as they are served again, without the managers wondering if the customer will still need them, so without thinking about either leaving them or replacing them.  I still want to point out that the care was very good and the staff generally friendly and smiling, except at the reception, except for the very friendly person who received me on arrival."

I understand that we are out of season, but good from there to close everything except the lobby bar.. Very average catering, it was necessary to announce to your customers that dinner would be served in the à la carte restaurant (1 starter, 1 course, 1 dessert) instead of the buffet before collecting the Half Board fee, something that is a scam in my humble opinion. Caring staff despite the austerity measures imposed."

Catering, the weak point, promise of five restaurants when in reality only one is open for lunch and another for dinner. Besides, the cuisine lacks flavor. Decent breakfast.

The rooms were spacious and cleaned every day, fresh linen and towels were appreciated.  The buffet restaurant catered for a number of tastes, but could have a little more variety. The waiters were excellent!  The drinks served on all inclusive were tasty and plentiful, and the barmen never skimped on alcohol measures.  The weather was perfect and is a huge selling point to go to visit Tunisia.  The only thing I would mention is that the hotel is further away from the centre of Hammamet than you may think, so keep that in mind if you’re aiming to visit the town.  Thank you for a lovely holiday, from Will and Jess."

Food- there’s a good selection of food available at breakfast, lunch and dinner but no snacks available in between. It would be nice to see the pool bar open for drinks and snacks.  Entertainment- it’s a small animation team who are all friendly and provide activities all day and in the evening. A special shout out to Pikachu and Willy who made our holiday really special. We loved the aqua gym in the morning and their friendliness and enthusiasm.  Staff-Also a special shout to Adel who always found us a sun bed and looked after us bringing towels, pillows, tables, cushions etc. All the staff were super friendly in the hotel, they remembered our names and welcomed us every time they saw us.   We walked to the beach one day but nothing was open and it was dirty and uncared for with no staff and no sign that it had been open at all.   The staff really made this a special holiday for us.

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Thalasso Sousse hotel and I must say that the experience was extremely disappointing. From the moment we arrived, the welcome was cold and impersonal, without any effort to make us comfortable.  The food was far below expectations for a hotel of this category: few choices, poor quality, and often served lukewarm. The worst part was witnessing the boss’ behaviour towards his own staff. In front of customers, he allowed himself humiliating remarks and a totally inappropriate authoritarian tone – an awkward and shocking scene.  As for the rooms, they were in catastrophic condition: questionable cleanliness, defective equipment, uncomfortable bedding, and a strong smell of moisture. Clearly, the establishment needs serious renovations and a complete rethinking of its management.  I definitely do not recommend this hotel, either for a relaxing or professional stay. There is much better in Sousse for the same price, with true respect for the customer and staff."

It is not difficult to travel around the city by taxi or on foot, either for sightseeing or shopping. There is a place to walk. Hotel rooms are standard. Cons: when they take the towels when cleaning, they don't always return them soon. There are no refrigerators in the rooms. They're brought in on request, if you have to and for a fee. I recommend not cranky tourists who do not want to overpay for holidays."

The animators are super nice, with an overflowing energy and leave no one alone.In barely 24 hours, they know our first names and know how to lead us into great games creating convivial moments between holidaymakers. We were even able to make friends thanks to them. All the staff is super, helpful and helpful. The pool and proximity to the beach make it a perfect place for a great holiday."

We were booked for it through Loveholidays and were not informed of it by either Loveholidays or the hotel.  Friends and I were shocked and panicked when we arrived late evening. We didn't know where to go or who to contact.  Loveholidays had an emergency phone number but it was useless as I only bought a data sim and couldn't make calls.   Thanks to our wonderful driver from the local taxi firm KBCar, who found out we were transferred to another hotel nearby. He then took us there free of charge.   So if you are booked for it is the next few weeks double check before you leave for your trip that it has reopened. Didn't want to give any stars but had to give one in order to post this review."

Photos on supports.  Reimbursement of sheets at 25 euros supposed to have come from Italy while for a mediocre hotel we suspect that it comes from Tunis at max 5 euros .. and besides they were yellow because obsolete.  You have to pay 10 euros to have a towel and 1 turkey to have it cleaned. Very petty protocol. I think that's how it is in most hotels, guests are there to pay only.  I was lied about the mini club being said from 3 years old and arrive there I receive an email to tell me that no it is 4 years. Good because the animator tired of the day before shows videos on mobile to children.  See photo 📷  Music at the bottom until midnight windows that move so loud the bass are. We had to change our room to repack five bags without any help.  Here's to our vacation. Fortunately the sun was there as well as the sea."

        "review_text": "First I would like to say that I love this hotel so read the review instead of the title.  I come to this hotel since 2018 I always found a great atmosphere but this year I was a little disappointed there are two hotels there is the meninx near the beach and there is the Riad meninx a little further away. the two hotels are connected the Meninx has a more lively atmosphere with most of the entertainment team and the Riad is a quieter and more relaxing hotel.  I was settled in Riyadh but I often went to spend my days at the meninx in relation to animation.  Let's start with the positives I found this year at the reception it was perfect and nickel I was very well received by the receptionist the same day I arrived and with mint tea each time I showed up at the reception or each time I had a problem there was a positive reaction from this service there in a quarter of an hour my problem was solved it was perfect, it was nickel,  at the household level it was perfect the housekeeper was discreet I never saw her the housekeeping was perfect the housekeeping was done I had nothing wrong everything was nicke it was perfect,  at the level of the restaurant there I had nothing to complain about I could always find what I wanted to eat whether for dessert or dish of resistance as they say, the waiter always had a kind word no more or less as they say and he always knew what we drank as a drink nothing to complain about at that level in addition the person responsible for the restaurant spent every day either at lunch or in the evening taking a walk in the restaurant to see if everything went well at the customers were satisfied it was perfect at this level, let's now move on to the level of animation so two hotels so two entertainment teams. The animation in this hotel has always been the highlight of this hotel it was always great I never had anything wrong with it but this year it was completely different.  we'll go first through the positives the positives in terms of animation the shows are always there the cabaret dance shows were great , the halloween decor perfect, the couples game show perfect the animator Ahouse had a quirky humor and well placed as they say that passed very well it was a humor without mockery compared to the customer, it was perfect a lot of laughter and joy.Now by the animators the manager of the Riad Ahouse always had a kind word always said hello every morning and was of a discretion no more or less Ghali perfect always smiling nothing wrong at this level, Lariss always very good dancer me who knew him when he arrived in May June 2022 what evolution for this animator always a kind word always smiling nothing wrong  Regarding the intern Kimo and Zizou always nice always smiling and a little bit joker at times but it went very well. All these facilitators I just appointed speak with all the clients without exception  However, for the rest of the animation that I will not name, they will recognize each other. I've been extremely disappointed me who's been here for 6 years I don't want to be the exception but all the customers pay the same service so we all have to have the same service.  I notice that some facilitators never say hello it's a lack of respect for the customer.  When we work with clients, the minimum is morning morning. I don't ask for communication every day.  Besides, I usually play pétanque and this year no animator has come to rest me to play pétanque and I do not understand  Not why.  Did this activity disappear from the club? I had darts, aqua aerobics and gym. For dj Alex , it would be nice if he had several playlists because when we come to every night we know the playlist by heart of the music and the list by heart so it's a little awkward. regarding the other animators as I said I don't want to name them they will recognize themselves there was a total indifference and I don't know why usually me when I come I say hello They come to talk to me nothing at all inexistence I know that it's the end of the season I know that everyone is tired so why some amateurs say hello are smiling and kind and others are not explain me I don't understand despite this little inconvenience it will not stop me from coming back to this hotel with my family or friends because I have always found a great and perfect atmosphere"

Pool level: the maintenance gentleman dipped the broom in the pool to clean under the deckchairs while we were in the water. We saw once on arrival the only world tourism animators we managed by ourselves for the rest of the stay and return schedules no one guided us.  I do not recommend this hotel too many negatives and again very dirty. Hotel never maintained a shame."

        "review_text": "As a group of 35 people spent two nights in El Ain Hotel, having two meals in our stay. Dinner buffet the first night was great with plethora of food based on meat, while the second night was lesser based on fish. Quality was good but the cleaning of tablecloths and cutlery was horrible. Maitre was rude and the service unwilling. The same was about the breakfast. There are two swimming pools , one outside and one inside, both filthy and uncared. No towels available also. Our rooms were around the main building, bungalow alike, quite clean with enough amenities, no welcome water though and the running water was full of salt making cleaning an ordeal. Anyway the change sheets everyday. Generally don’t expect cleaning by European standards, dead bags, broken and cracked glasses and plates are common site in the restaurant."

The rooms are scattered around with many steps, not ideal for people with walking difficulty. The rooms are clean, not big but comfortable enough especially if you’re alone, there is no complimentary water or tea/ coffee. The bathroom is not big, separated from the toilet, with soap, bath foam and shampoo. There is a hair dryer. Dinner is buffet, average and finishing fast, breakfast buffet is confusing, apparently large but lacking many things (just oranges for fruit, only one kind of tea and hard to find, no choice of cereals, eggs only hard boiled etc). The staff is not very helpful"

The rooms are decent and the overall atmosphere of the hotel is pleasant.  Unfortunately, our experience was marred by the behaviour of the staff, particularly the catering staff. The servers seemed completely disinterested in the customers. We have been repeatedly ignored, forced to raise our voices or be noticed, and have often been treated with cold or even rude answers. No effort to welcome with a smile or to make the stay pleasant. The nightclub was great but the DJ was tense, we sang or danced too much it pissed him off and cut the music   It’s a shame because the hotel’s potential is real, but the lack of professionalism and respect from the staff means we don’t have a good memory of the service. An improvement in this level would really be necessary for the experience to be up to the level of the place."

How to tell you that an all-in means what it means, the bar has hours ranging from 10:30 to midnight, the problem in there is that the waiters do not like to do their job they are friendly just with the women, experience going with your wife to the bar and you will see that they will only look at them and not in the eyes, however at 11:45 pm which means that the bar was always open I was asked to drink but the waiters did not want to serve me or anyone else besides they were only slowing down and making return trips in the kitchen not to serve us on purpose, then asking for drink the waiter answers me \"NARDINMOUK I speak with him\" asking me what it meant I ask people there and answers that it means \"race to your mother\" so I decide to go ask him why he says that, he starts laughing in my face then the manager of the bar comes to me and says MY FRIEND THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IT IS A VERY GOOD WAITER HE WOULD NEVER HAVE SAID THAT. Going to see the manager the next day, he answers me my staff is the best he would not allow to tell you that so I tell him to look at the cameras because I knew the precise moment by asking him that he shows me the video in the same place but 1 hour earlier then I tell him it is not that time and I answer him precisely the time at which it knows past but what he does he shows me yet another moment just before it happens and cuts just when it was going to happen. He denies and then starts to rub shoulders with me and tell me you’re like my son I don’t want anything to do with you I just want you to have a good trip and that’s all , the next day he came to tell me that it was my fault because we were asking for a lot of drinks at that time and that he understood the gesture his employee had made if he had really done it because he still wouldn’t confess. Otherwise nothing else to say super nice housekeeper exceptional hotel just restaurant as at the bar where the staff is not friendly at all."

Frankly I've never been to an exclusive hotel and they change their minds  The spa is also a very good way to relax... it is worth the price, with several formula adapted to each need, we would just miss access to a Jacuzzi;)   The hotel is well maintained... the only negatives we could find there: wifi not available in the rooms but in the living room and double beds so separate not convenient for a couple   Thank you for this week:)"

The restaurant the varied buffets with 2x per week theme dinner in addition to the buffet restaurant, the service is almost impeccable, the staff is professional and always smiling.

        "review_title": "Mixed Review – Great Value for the Price, But Room for Improvement",
        "review_text": "We booked this hotel for our family of 5 at a very reasonable price, so we didn’t expect luxury, but we did hope for the basics to be in place.  On the negative side, the room we were given was quite outdated, something from the 80s, and not very well maintained. There was only one socket in the entire room, and it was occupied by the TV, so charging electronic devices was always a challenge, especially with a family of 5. This led to constant queues for the one available socket. The toilet, shower, and kitchenette were all extremely old, to the point where we didn’t even use the kitchenette, but of course, we had to rely on the toilet and shower facilities. Cleaning also didn’t seem to be a priority. The lighting, storage, wardrobes, and windows were all very old and in desperate need of an upgrade.  Breakfast was decent enough, especially considering the price we paid.  On the positive side, there was a reasonably well-kept rooftop swimming pool with stunning views of the trees and the beach/sea in the background. The hotel also had a nice courtyard with plenty of greenery and seating, perfect for relaxing. The reception area was welcoming, and the hammam (spa) on the ground floor offered good service at a very reasonable price. We also had the pleasure of meeting Chawki, a very helpful person who sat by the entrance to the courtyard during the day. He offered us a Quad package at a very reasonable price, far cheaper than any quotes we had gotten from other sources. He is also a very good source of information on anything you need, and one of very few people who speaks English well enough to have a good conversation.  The staff were generally helpful, although interactions were somewhat limited since I don't speak French or Arabic, and English isn’t widely spoken in Tunisia.  The best feature of the hotel is its location. You’re not in Yasmine Hammamet, which is shiny, busy, and full of tourist traps with overzealous shopkeepers and taxi drivers who think it’s acceptable to charge 5 times the regular fare. Instead, you’re in the old Hammamet, or as the locals call it, the real Hammamet, not the touristy version.  Right outside the hotel to your left, you'll find plenty of food stalls, coffee shops, and juice bars offering fresh, tasty food at prices geared toward locals. If you prefer a restaurant experience, there are plenty of good options nearby. The old fort and old medina are just a 5-minute walk away, and the public beach is about a 2-minute walk. While you might need to walk a little further to find a cleaner spot, it’s not much of a hassle. Near the fort, there’s also an MG City supermarket, where you can pick up all your daily essentials.  There’s a taxi stand very near the supermarket. While the taxi stand marshal made it clear that the drivers will not use meters as they are only for Tunisians, we were given a fixed price for our ride to Yasmine Hammamet (10 Dinars). This now seems like a reasonable fare, especially compared to the much higher prices we were quoted by taxi drivers in Yasmine Hammamet.  Coming out of the hotel to your right, you’ll find an Orange shop where you can get a SIM card and data package, as well as a currency exchange with great rates. There’s also a very nice cafe arounf the corner where you can grab a coffee or a fresh orange juice for about 3 Dinars.  The Louage station to get back to Tunis is only a 5-minute walk away, on Avenue Mongi Slim, just outside Hammamet Hospital. Even with heavy suitcases and kids in tow, we managed to get there in about 8 minutes. Right near the station, there are plenty of food options, with the standout being Two M Pizzeria on Avenue Taleb el Ezzabi. There’s also Ettahrir restaurant (listed as Liberation restaurant on Google Maps), a traditional Tunisian spot, nearby on Avenue de la Liberation.  Overall, while the room itself was a disappointment, the hotel and the experience, considering the price we paid for a family of 5, were not bad. I hope that the owner/management will invest in modernising the rooms to bring this place back to its former glory, as it must have been quite charming in its prime."

Everything is clean and maintained every day. The staff is very friendly. We took full board. The buffet may be a little repetitive but they are attentive and responsive. The bar and outside are nice with entertainment some evenings. The pool is not heated so water too cold despite the good temperatures in October. We therefore preferred the beach of the hotel. There again pleasant staff and little care. In the lobby of the hotel 2 people offer excursions. We must not stop at the typical and somewhat insistent sales methods. They are finally very friendly and did not hesitate to help us when we encountered a problem with transport to the airport, without expecting anything in return. We did the camel tour and it was perfect! The guide is very interesting, speaks several languages. Pleasant walk with tasting and entertainment at the end."

        "review_text": "I booked one night in this hotel. Upon arrival, met with a wonderful receptionist Sami who offered me welcome drink and a place of Tunisian dessert. He upgraded my room to a suite for free. Well, the room or now the suite is so nice and big. A/C is not working. Went down to the reception and asked to fix the A/C and got the answer that it’s not working in the whole property for maintenance. Went outside to buy a bottle of water because I lack it in the room. Tried one hour to struggle with the weather and later on, decided to change the hotel. Again went down asking Sami to find me any solution or I have to leave with bad feelings. Such a gentleman, he upgraded me again to a bungalow, means additional kitchen and balcony. Wow, at last I can open the room door and the balcony door so as to get better.  Breakfast is so simple. Location is great, few minutes from the beach.  What I like in there is the great staff and the location of the hotel. Please you have to inform your customers about any maintenance in advance but don’t let them be in."

        "review_text": "This is a good standard 3-star hotel, within easy walking distance to town and many restaurants. It is clean throughout the hotel. The hotel is suitable for people who want to get out and explore a bit. As someone else mentioned, there is a bit of faded charm to it.  There is a rooftop pool and pool bar area - probably the best feature at this hotel - with views of the sea from here. There is also a courtyard bar. There's a ping pong table on the roof as well and paddles are available with a small deposit.  Breakfast is available as an optional extra, a reasonable 15 dt per person, though we preferred just to go out to a cafe.  Breakfast includes things like croissants, boiled eggs, Ouja (a Tunisian tomato and pepper sauce with eggs) and even a crepe making station. There is dinner for 30 dt.  There were regularly 5-6 tables of people dining.  A few other restaurants in the area have dinner at around the same price so we preferred to choose something different every night.  There was entertainment (a guy playing guitar and singing some old eric Clapton songs) on just one one night when we were there, which was a relief as I'm not really keen on all those so-called entertainments and animation.  If you're looking for one of those places that has entertainment every day then this hotel may not be your best bet.    At the front right of the hotel is a restaurant where they have music at night. Fortunately our rooms were on the back side and we couldn't hear anything at all from this.  Not sure how you'd fare if your room was at the front.  Regarding the staff, some are really friendly and helpful. Two of the front desk staff were great. I had a nice conversation with the middle-aged lady receptionist.   For excursions, there are a couple of guys at the hotel selling them pretty reasonably, about 120dt. Horse riding and camel riding and things like that.  They're just doing their job so try not to mind even if they ask you several times.  If you're not interested just politely tell them you're not planning on any excursions.  There are busses from the town's main bus terminal (about 10 minutes walk) to Tunis (one hour) and Nabuel (half an hour). There's also a train station that you can get to by taxi with trains for Tunis.  Nearby, the Cafe de la Plage is right on the beach where you can sip coffee or have snacks while watching the sea and the fishermen.  They are in a slow process of renovating the rooms.  We were offered an upgrade to a renovated room for an extra fee which we decided to go for.  Nicer bathroom and shower and the room just feels fresher and more modern.  It seemed like the upgrade money went straight into the receptionist's pocket, though of course I could be mistaken.   One of the staff is an older lady who seems like she's gotten a bit fed up answering guests questions. I asked here where I could put a small bag I was throwing away and she pointed outside. When I asked her what she meant she sort of rolled her eyes, took the bag, went out in front of the hotel and deposited it in a bin in the street! (Don't they have bins in the hotel?)  Overall I can recommend the hotel and would be likely to return if we come back to Hammamet."

This stay was placed under the sign of relaxation and well-being. The room was spotlessly clean and provided impeccable comfort, and the whole establishment is maintained with obvious care. The friendly and professional staff – be it the reception manager, the maids, the waiters or Chiheb at the entrance – made this experience unforgettable. However, I would like to make a comment regarding the reception upon my arrival. Indeed, the receptionist, Miss Rym, initially left me without attention, preferring to continue a telephone conversation without acknowledging my presence. She then informed me that the official check-in time was set at 3pm, which contradicted the information provided in advance by the travel agency, which stipulated a check-in time from 2pm. This discrepancy, although minor, has caused some discomfort and would merit better coordination between the various intermediaries in the future to ensure a more harmonious customer experience."

Bar shuts at 12/midnight but they let you stay in there after which is nice. The blue Lagoon cocktail was my favourite and the lovley waiter in the afternoon makes a yummy green one. He used to bring them to our sunbed which I thought was lovley.   Sometimes it was hard to get a sunbed so I dunno how it is in high season. You are also not allowed to reserve beds.   The food is okay but not very hot but the deserts are delightful.  At breakfast they do nice omlettes The resturant manager Ali is soooo lovley and was always so pleased to see us. He's got really got banter.   I tried eating out a couple times as wanted to taste real Tunisian food and that did not disappoint.   This hotel is more catered to family's and couples. So if your a group of friends this might be a bit boring for you. The staff make this hotel luckily. The beds are like concrete and so are the pillows 😢 but the hotel is clean and friendly.   Momo taught us Arabic on the first day and I thought this was really nice.  Do not buy trips from this hotel the guy is a scammer!!!  I payed £12 For a boat trip with pickup and drop off and dinner and a couple from this hotel was on the same boat and payed £50!! When we got back from the trip the rude man from the hotel was then demanding money from us. I called my travel agent and they said don't pay him nothing you already paid. 😂 So I told him to go away but I should of reported him. The camera man is really friendly and makes you feel like a celebrity every night lol I probably wouldn't stay here again but I would defiantly come back to Tunisia as it's got the friendliest people I've ever met.  💕"

The arrival was super organized with welcome drink, the rooms clean and were freshened up every day. The non-alcoholic minibar was also always filled. All staff were friendly and accommodating. The food was varied, as I said it is an AI hotel where there is everything every day and you can eat something different every day. The selection of AI drinks was really good, you know that differently. You should calculate the price m you pay doet times down to the day. That was 100 euros per day with 3 x food, drinks have end and snacks in between. Not counting the flight and transfer.  Nevertheless, I would have a few reviews: • in the spa area there was no price list, so I have to assume that the prices vary • it would be nice if you could pay by card at the reception, as at the beginning of the holiday a tourist tax is required, which you would like to pay by card"

A “true 5 star” is 500€ a night without side.  If you want breakfast, lunch and dinner, you will have to pay extra.  Here, everything is included, 3 meals a day, real squeezed orange juice for breakfast, pastries etc.  The majority of staff are courteous, hardworking and dedicated.  The professional reception, the whole team of animators present, without being invasive, and with a rare sympathy. This hotel with its feet in the water and a beautiful beach is our happiness, we who come here for the 4th time, the welcome is always marked and friendly. The rooms are spacious, made every day.

Thanks also to the teams of 2 bars and a cuckoo from France to Mohammed who will celebrate his birthday on Sunday. Very nice complex in general and beautiful swimming pools, secure hotel and guards at each corner with entrance control. The biggest part of this hotel is the entertainment: the animators are uninteresting and soft of the knee and I know what I'm talking about having done animation myself in campsites clubs and holiday villages for 8 years. Animations non-existent and uninteresting like the animators. Who also do their rehearsals around the pool and repeat the same music 5 times before they know how to chain 3 steps. In short, no interest in the animation division  Everything else was super thank you to him."

        "review_text": "Bonjour! This was a nice, clean and well kept hotel with excellent, welcoming staff throughout. 99.99% of the tourists are French, and the wife and I was the other 0.01%. However, all the staff and most French spoke good English, so no problems at all. We even learnt a little French too. There's was a bit of renovation going on outside but nothing to spoil our stay.  A very good selection of international buffet food on offer for breakfast, lunch and evening meal, so no complaints there. As in most hotels you had to book the a-la-carte restaurant and it was pre-order traditional Tunisian dishes, which we enjoyed very much. The all-inclusive drinks selection was more than satisfactory too.  There is plenty of nice quite areas to sunbath, if you prefer, as the main pool has the usual boom-boom music playing most of the day.  The evening entertainment was a bit of a let down (as there wasn't much, if any at all) but that didn't bother us with only being there for 3 nights. However, I'm sure that will change in high season. Day and night, I believe young children would probably get very bored, very quickly here, although, again, this could change in high season.  Djerba centre/souks (only £4ew in taxi) was nice but as you'd expect, lots of bazaars selling the same stuff, every owner wanting you to look around their shop, we did buy a few things but didn't stay long . There was not much going on at the Marina either.   All-in-all a pleasant and enjoyable stay, but 3 nights/4 days was definitely enough for us as there's not much to do inside or outside of the hotel, apart from walk on the beach."

        "review_text": "Tour package with Fram. 2 adults (43 years) + 2 teenagers (12 & 16 years). Family very easy and grateful.  Pros: - Very nice entrance and very nice hall (clean, huge and bright).  - Feeling safe and pleasant staff. -Good general welcome.  - Spacious room.  - Lovely room staff (Walid was very caring all stay, a wonderful meeting).  - The California massage was really deep (thanks Nejma). - Excursions proposed as the Sahara, a unique experience to do. Admittedly it was long (1200km in 2 days) but some spots were worth the trip (oasis, 4x4, El Jem, salt lake, camel ride...). - Karaoke evenings (atmosphere thanks to us and some other travelers). -Spacious restaurant and good cuisine but little varied, it was good but every day the same, except a small buffet apart that we had not seen in the beginning. Great location! Hotel in front of the sea and right next to the Hammamet Medina 15-20 minutes walk from the Marina. - Room cleaned every day and towels changed. Bar open late.  Pros: -The smell of cigarettes!!! Travelers smoke at the bar and it spreads all over the lobby. This is really unpleasant! A vacationer next to our room smoked in hers and the smell spilled down the hall and into our room. Hotel refreshed but on old. It is clean but the details need to be reviewed. The furniture is old and the taps \"eaten\" by the products, it's neglected. -The animation is summary, the adorable Asma must lead workshops without materials.  - Activity equipment completely worn out by a 5* hotel (ping pong table, rackets, by the pool the arcade games scream \"At the boarding!\" every 45 seconds, we went to turn it off by the way).  - Very nice pool but the surroundings are neglected with slabs and lawn/land... maybe it was not the time to welcome tourists yet, but no matter when you arrive, you paid for your vacation. - Unpleasant restaurant when it is invaded by speakers (3 conferences \"doctors, technology  and metrology\" during our holidays). Endless lines at the buffet and when it was our turn there was nothing left despite the turn of the room managers so that nothing was missing. They seemed overwhelmed especially at the metrology conference. - Bug of phones in rooms; woken for 2 days, 3x at night by untimely ringtones. Even the neighbors' rooms rang during the night and at nap time. I must have complained 3x. - Very firm bedding (we like it softer, each one his tastes) - Soundproofing of windows (single glazing). We were above the pool, facing the sea.The first days there were not many people but when families with children arrived it became too noisy. - The spa right next to the indoor pool. When I was scrubbing and wrapping, we could hear the kids screaming next door. Horrible for a moment of serenity. - If you like blow-drying, take your hair dryer because the hotel's is dated (it looks like a phone with a big pipe)  Points + and - but we had a good stay in general. Compared to some other 5* hotels already done in Djerba, Tunisia or Marrakech, this one was satisfactory. Another huge thank you to the lovely Walid (server), a wise and unique man."

The hotel is beautiful with two outsite swiming pools as well as one indoor. All very clean and nice to spend a relaxing time. One drawback the time available for the swiming pool from 8 am to 6 pm. But im sure in the summer season this changes for sure. The beach is in front of the hotel. The water was very clean also. The buffet very satisfactory, very good from my point of view.  You have lots of different foods and the fish is very fresh and it is prepared in front of you as well as the omelettes, the pasta and many more things. The rooms are nice, clean and big, the beds comfortable. Mine had a balcony,  you could see the sea. I want to highlight also that the spa was really nice, the person in charge Yaya,  was so nice with us. He made everything a great experience. Also the enterteinment man Hamza was very fun and we had music and karaoke everyday. I love singing, 💕.  I hope to return back to this hotel.  Its highly recommended ."

Despite this, the hotel was fully prepared for the reception: everything is clean, well maintained, everything works like clockwork. The hotel is located near the airport, I had the shortest transfer in my life - 3 minutes. This is particularly true for families with children. I had an early run, had no problem solving it.  Rooms are clean, spacious. Towels and linen are new. The hotel's food is fine, thanks to the chef. Everything was delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient. Desserts, fruit, wine - all fresh and beautiful quality. The grounds are not small, there is no feeling of pounding. The beach strip is quite wide, clean, with virtually no algae. The entrance to the sea is smooth, it is safe to drive with small children and those who are not confident on the water. The sunbeds, the umbrellas, they were all there. Internet is fast and stable throughout the hotel except the beach. It's possible to work remotely for whoever is relevant. I would like to pay special tribute to the work of all hotel staff. Everyone works quickly and smoothly, I'm left with the feeling of being in a big, friendly family. The hotel has a massage parlour with various programmes. Salon owner Mehdi (doctor and part-time polyglot) will help to tailor the course to everyone's needs. A professional massage just brought me back to life! Highly recommended! The location is excellent - near the metro station, you can quickly get to both Sousse and Monastir. You can walk around these cities, organize a shopping or excursion program yourself. In summary: the price/quality ratio of the hotel is excellent, I will recommend to my friends and acquaintances. The hotel wishes success and prosperity for many years! Thank you for your wonderful holiday!"

And I didn't regret spending my vacation in this country! First of all, the season had just opened and tourists were scarce, there was no poolside, beach, queue for food. And we Russians could count on our fingers. Secondly, of the pros - the hotel's proximity to the airport (first brought, last taken!), near the subway station, the white sand beach, the sea is relatively clean and not deep, there is no seaweed and jellyfish, delicious food in the restaurant (fish every day), wine of good quality, separately prepare pizza and pancakes, polite waiters and always interested in health chefs! Animators - respect 👍🏻 Especially remembered handsome Sophen, who did not obsessively suggest anything to do, such as yoga or stretching, which we were happy to do)) Russian is not spoken much, but one feels that we are missed and the locals are very much waiting for our camback 🤩 Also in the hotel opened a massage parlor, whose owner Dr. Osteopath Mehdi, who worked for a long time in St. Petersburg (!) and speaks fluent Russian. Separately I want to mention masseur Shams 👍🏻 Truly, a professional from God🙏🏻 and I have something to compare. I took a course of five sessions and I was absolutely delighted! My personal recommendation!!! From the downside - you can see that the hotel has not been renovated in a long time. But you can close your eyes and not pick on it too much. I think if the prices of tickets to Tunisia are not draped, the people will go)) I am right, right!"

        "review_text": "Worst hotel I've ever been in! Arrived at the end of April, I thought I arrived in a ghost hotel... Everything was closed: the Spa, the indoor pool (empty), the gym, the discotheque, 1 only restaurant open and again, 4 dishes that fought for the few tourists present, no entertainment... a disaster!!! And I am not talking about the pitiful state of the hotel and especially the exteriors: everything is in a state of abandonment. If necessary, the tennis court could be used as a swimming pool... but as the outdoor pool is not heated, it is difficult to swim there! The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly waiters at the bars and restaurants. A big thank you to them because it is not possible to say that it is their managers who lead by example... The \"high places\" are arrogant and not kind at all."

        "review_text": "I'm in a hotel with a family with two kids. The Russians haven't visited Tunisia en masse in a long time and we are missed frankly (Arabs ask in Sousse and Monastir when we will return). Witnessed the start of the season.  The first thing that matters is that the staff really makes the rest better. I've been to Egypt many times, never seen that. To eat: the choice is small but everything is very, very delicious, satisfied, chef well done. Music: God forbid the animator who has such beautiful taste, we get high on this accompaniment. Beach: the best sand in the entire Mediterranean - I confirm. On the beach is safe for any age - very smooth entrance. Ten minutes from the hotel is not only the airport but also the ground subway: for 30 rubles you can drive to Sousse and Monastir, a beautiful plus Tunisia. Bar pile: wine from bottles is great, beer and spill and bottles - delicious. Pizza and pancakes are amazing. The children's slides have also come. The wi fi is chic like home in Russia: fast and stable, incredibly catching in the room and kids playing network games. The hotel is as old as anything in Tunisia, but beautiful, atmospheric. Although the Dessole chain has long since left Tunisia, the positive plume remains, we have nothing to pick on for the amount paid at the start of the season. Satisfied and would return again. The hotel easily changes dollars into dinars. Nouvelair is a great carrier, Grand is a great TO. Prosperity, love for Tunisia. I'll be there in a year, even in Bella Vista if I can. I recommend Tunisia, if the price is not excessive. Because the Turks and the Egyptians have already overstated it. Ah yes cons: beach towels for 10 bucks (inadmissible :)) and tourist tax, we charged 7,000p for two.  Thank you Bella Vista, thank you Tunisia!"

During the there was a group of special Animators who organized various attractions for guests and especially for children. Really very good, helpful and nice young people. Every evening they also organized discos in the rhythm of different music. There is also a man on the hotel premises who organizes various attractions outside the hotel, such as: a pirate ship cruise, camel riding and many others. The entire hotel team was very polite and helped us every time we had any questions."

The room, structurally, the beds are 2 singles side by side, not top but no big deal, we had a total of 4 rooms and discovered cockroaches of an inch in all the rooms, as well as odor problems with tap water. The housekeepers are impeccable, everything is well cleaned and they are very attentive to our well-being. Many thanks to them On the food side, quite repetitive, not enough local dishes for our taste, no tagine or couscous buffet, little or no local pastry... Doubtful hygiene in seafood (smells foul in the dishes concerned), Vegetable preparations and pasta from the outdoor cooking point taken out to heat at 10:45 and meat at 11:20 while cooking starts at 12:30,  The pizzas are great, the buffet in the morning, the omelets are wonderful. Coffee is of the soluble type and no juice, as chemical drinks type tang.  Dirty beach Few daytime and repetitive activities but evenings are fun The staff, you don't have to have any worries otherwise we are little helped (worries umbrella, problem of fight and nuisance of some unmanaged families, but nothing very serious, an annoyance also concerning some who openly flirt with young minors, quite uncomfortable... Otherwise, a large part is very helpful, special mentions to the young woman of the morning omelets and the outdoor hot spot, as well as Mohammed in the buffet room:  extremely helpful, smiling and friendly. The tall thin young man animator, super pleasant with all generations. The man in the black suit and long hair in the room, very nice and helpful. And so, what about Samah, alone, it brightens us the stay with a force, it is beautiful, full of heart, generosity, a lot of humor and the care of the residents constantly. We love him!!!  Finally, all-inclusive stay, at a low price, we get our money's worth, beautiful meetings, the Tunisians are great!"

Something we didn't know about before. As it says AC available.  The gym was in renovations. Disappointed again.  They have a nightclub on site. From 11.30pm until 4am. Loud music and vibrations from the speakers. It was horrendous. When asked to move they said no as no rooms were available. Awful   Positive side most of the staff were nice accept the guy on reception. He wasn't helpful at all   The food wasn't for me. But maybe each to their own.

Nothing wrong.  Animation side: we were able to do mini disco every night with my daughter. Top animators, bingo evening, fakir, cabaret, Arabic class, a course on Tunisian cuisine. An oriental dance class.  Good point for the mini club 👍, with an animator who takes care of the children to leave us a little quiet to enjoy a little: Lego activities, coloring and puzzles. My daughter had a good time  Excursion: we made an excursion to Sousse and an excursion with the camels and visit a Berber village 👍 although my daughter was scared, everything went well."

A special mention to Samah the waiter who was always very attentive to us during our stay, to the small care and pleasant with the children really a brave and hardworking man and the only one who took the crease to come and ask us what we wanted to drink and if need anything, while with the others it was necessary to claim.  We stayed in a comfortable surface duplex family room but a refreshment would be expected (wallpaper unstuck, no shower wall). The sound insulation is poor and you can hear the noises of neighboring rooms as well as the nearby discotheque.  Beach accessible directly from the hotel with clear water despite the algae but cleaned regularly.  You will have to take the bus or taxi for each trip, no amenities are located nearby, taxis in front of the hotel charge exorbitant prices."

I was able to attend several evenings and activities (mini disco, gymnastic activity). All are super friendly and welcoming. The mini club leader is close to the children and loves working with them and it shows. The kids are thrilled to go and are happy to be together and it’s great to see, especially for a former Mini Club manager like me. I congratulate all the teams who make this stay unforgettable in every way.  Personally, I was able to spend a week of vacation in a beautiful hotel with friendly teams for children and adults alike.  I see pull my hat and I'll see you soon with my little brother who will be delighted to make friends at the mini club."

        "review_text": "Pros: The hotel is beautiful, the outdoor pools are fresh but amazing, fortunately there was the heated pool (stay April/May). Very clean hotel. The buffet is very good but almost every day the same dishes. Kids slides are great!  Cons: I confirm the nuisance of the club until 4am. Animations are missing, darts and pétanque only. The facilitator of the children's club does not take care of the children, she remains frozen on her phone and does not watch! (child found by the pool alone). You don't let kids in swimsuits into the hotel, but women who are, that's okay. You must regularly tip if you want to have cutlery quickly at the table, otherwise it takes time! The garden view is actually a view of a vacant lot where they do work from 6am to put sand back on the beach. Don't think you're going home rested!  Evening themes are not respected, it is day to day because sometimes the room is reserved for occasions (wedding, birthday). Remember to take a book or card game because in case of rain no animation is offered. Really bad because the setting is really beautiful!"

        "review_text": "A humiliating and disappointing experience at the Hotel Skanes Sérail – Monastir I booked a double room at this hotel via an international platform for me and my French companion. From the moment we arrived, we faced a discriminatory attitude. I was informed that I could not share the room at the same rate because I do not have a French residence permit, and I was required to pay an extra amount equivalent to almost the total amount of the reservation. No official document was presented to us, and when asked about the rules, they replied that they were ‘oral rules’, which is totally contrary to Tunisian and international law. Legal clarification: In Tunisia, no law provides for the payment of additional fees not mentioned in the final booking. The tourist tax is fixed and does not depend on nationality or residence status. Racist behaviour of employees: Being multilingual and speaking the local Tunisian language, I heard several employees insult European tourists thinking they did not understand. It was repugnant. I had two altercations with employees because of these unacceptable comments and behaviours. Poor and shameful services: Rooms without soap, without efficient air conditioning in May, and without mini fridge. Cleaning is done after 2pm, but there is a knock on the door from 9am to remove the towels. Presence of flying insects, especially in the bathroom. Dirty pool, foul smell of the sea due to algae. Elevator down almost every day. Constant harassment by tour and massage vendors in the hotel. Catering and Staff Attitude: Poor quality food without variety. No polite words like \"hello\" or \"good evening.\" Implicit pressure to tip to be treated well. Taxis in front of the hotel charge excessive amounts. The hotel shop sells in euros at inflated prices, which is illegal in Tunisia. Conclusion: This is the worst hotel experience I’ve ever had: discrimination, negligence, filth and total disrespect. I would not recommend this hotel to any foreign traveler.  English: A Humiliating and Disappointing Experience at Skanes Serail Hotel – Monastir I booked a double room at this hotel via an international platform for myself and my French partner. From the moment we arrived, we faced clear discrimination. I was told I couldn’t share the room at the same rate because I don’t hold a French residence permit, and I was asked to pay an extra fee almost equal to the original booking amount. When we requested written rules, we were told these are “oral policies,” which clearly violate both Tunisian and international law. Legal Note: Tunisian law does not allow extra fees not mentioned in the final booking invoice. The tourist tax is fixed and does not depend on nationality or residence status. Racist employee behavior: As I speak several languages including Tunisian Arabic, I overheard several employees insulting European tourists in the local language, assuming they wouldn’t understand. This was disgusting. I had two confrontations with staff over these racist and unacceptable actions. Poor and shameful service: Rooms without soap, no working air conditioning in May, and no mini-fridge. Housekeeping after 2 PM, yet towels are collected as early as 9 AM. Flying insects everywhere, especially in the bathroom. Dirty pool and foul smell from the sea due to algae. Elevator out of order almost daily. Constant harassment from excursion and massage sellers inside the hotel. Food and staff behavior:  Low-quality, repetitive food. No greetings like “good morning” or “good evening.” Strong pressure to tip in order to be treated respectfully. Taxi drivers outside overcharge tourists. The hotel shop sells in euros at double the local market prices, which is illegal. Conclusion: This was my worst hotel experience ever — discrimination, filth, neglect, and disrespect. I strongly advise against staying at this hotel, especially for foreign couples.

Schon bei unserer Ankunft wurden wir mit offener Diskriminierung konfrontiert. Man sagte mir, dass ich das Zimmer nicht zum gleichen Preis teilen könne, weil ich keine französische Aufenthaltserlaubnis habe, und verlangte eine zusätzliche Gebühr, die fast dem ursprünglichen Buchungsbetrag entsprach. Auf Nachfrage nach einer schriftlichen Regelung hieß es lediglich, dies seien „mündliche Vorschriften“ – ein klarer Verstoß gegen das tunesische und internationale Recht.

When we arrived the hotel looked ok from the outside, it has a fair opposite which my kids were really excited about. On arrival there were big gangs of men sat outside and prostitutes leaving. Reception staff were rude and not helpful at all. The rooms was disgusting. Our feet stuck to the carpet, stains on carpets and beds and hair in the bath. The next morning we went to breakfast it was dark and not a single English person in there. As a blonde woman I was stared at by all men and woman. I have never felt so scarred.  I called the travel agent and they were not helpful at all, just told us to call the police. So we got our bags and jumped in a taxi, 5 minutes down the road was an amazing hotel called Marhaba Palace. They couldn’t help us enough. Sad to say we lost our money on that hotel but the move was worth every penny. Please please do not try this hotel."

You have to offer a few dinars to the agent so that he authorizes access to the swimming pool with jacuzzi. The rapas have no taste of rotten fruit, especially the cheese, it looks like soap.

The first time it was simply ignored, the second time they said they would take care of it but nothing happened. The bed linen is not changed. So really catastrophic. I have already been to many 4 star hotels in Tunisia but I have never had anything like this. Also in the restaurant: many local people come in groups (on excursions from other Tunisian cities) and empty the buffet in 5 minutes! It takes a long time for the buffet to be refilled... In the room (again): the minibar is always warm. The cooling doesn't work.  All in all I would avoid this hotel! It was our last time here in the hotel."

Half of the beach has become private and paid television does not work. No wifi in the rooms  The food is not enough for everyone and a tail of tongue during dinner For lunch there is one and only fast football outside in front of the hotel and as a result you have to queue for 2 hours to buy a sandwich (the queue in the hotel and outside Also ) Salafists, veiled people, people of all kinds reside in this hotel  lots of fights, noise and problems at night in front of the hotel and the disco. It is better to close this hotel, it gives a very bad image to hotels in Tunisia; NEVER AGAIN will I come back to THIS HOTEL or to Sousse"

Three light bulbs missing, it was so dark it was like Hannibal Lectors cell. Reported to reception and maintenance man came up straight away. Looked at missing bulbs and came back within 10 minutes to replace them all. This hotel is so dark and dreary I honestly thought it was named after Hannibal Lector (it might be, I’m still unsure). Everywhere you go it’s dark. We never ate here at all and ate out everyday. On our short visit it was rammed with lusty Algerian single men which, for two women is intimidating. My daughter sought help from the pool attendant, he looked after her and kept her safe from all those said lusty men. He was brilliant, can’t fault him. Friendly, protective and he respected women. On the day before we left, two different reception staff said our transfer coach to Enfidah was 9am. Arrived at reception in good time and no coach. Further investigation at reception revealed the two reception staff didn’t have a clue and the coach arrived at 8am so we missed it. A fantastic reception member managed to call us a taxi and we made our flight home in time. We will never go back here. Absolutely awful stay. It was an urgent late booking and we took what we could get. I was not impressed at all. Nice room and bathroom. Can’t say much else in good terms about this place. Definitely not great for lone female travellers."

        "review_text": "Highly recommended, this is a review from someone that has done 4 TUI Blues previously.   We had a 7 month old baby and we stayed for 7 nights in May 2025.  All the staff were fantastic with the baby and made her laugh and smile throughout the entire stay. Thank you very much.  Maha is the general manager and you can tell she takes great pride in her hotel and ensuring all the guests are happy daily. You always see her walking around talking to guests daily. There is an onside TUI rep who is friendly and approachable and you can buy activities if required.   Room:  Room was very clean and spacious, modern style with balcony. The room had an open sink and shower(with a door) and the toilet was in a separate closed bathroom. The cleaner attended everyday and cleaned to a high standard with fresh towels, clean floor and nice made up bed, we tipped the cleaner 20 Dinar and she was very appreciative.   When we booked the hotel, we asked for a double bed specifically and we received 2 singles. The reception were quick at sorting this the next day and fufiled our request.  We asked for a shower room on the day of departure and we were allowed 30 mins free of charge l  Restaurant and Bars: There is a main Buffett restaurant, a A La Carte which we did not book and a pool bar cafe for lunch meals. There was also a restaurant on the beach front, however this was closed for repairs at the time of our visit.  There is also a coffee shop restaurant which has a selection of sandwich’s, Pastries and Cakes all day.  The main buffet restaurant had a wide selection of vegetarian, vegan and meat options, a wide source of options to meet all needs. I was impressed by the freshly baked croissants and pizzas daily. There was also a pasta bar for lunch and dinner. There was a wide range of vegetarian and vegan options, and as being a vegetarian for 25 years, I had no issues with choice. There is a wide range of salad options and fresh fruits.   We always ate inside behind the deserts counter and the restaurant staff were always attentive to the requirement of the high chair on each meal time and would support with this.  The restaurant staff were always interacting with our baby keeping her company whilst we ate our food.   Restaurant was clean and tidy.  There was a few occasions with the food labelling was incorrect. One of the food labels states Lamb was Vegetarian and there was a Chicken Dish in the Vegan section. However, when mention to staff, this was rectified quickly acknowledged the error. As we had the baby we never drank alcohol and I would recommend placing some more mocktails on the menu, there was only 4. I asked if they could do an alcoholic cocktails without alcohol e.g Pina Colada; but they stated they could not do this.  We arrived at 22:00 one evening so we missed the dinner. They provided sandwiches as a a good will gesture on arrival. However, the only sandwich’s they had was Ham Sandwich. I understand it was a late arrival and good will gesture, however, a cheese sandwich to be included would be my recommendation to cater for deity requirements. The member of staff said to take the ham out of the sandwich…..  Pool: This was one of the cleanest pools I have ever seen in any hotel. The pool is spotless. There are 4 pools, one large one and 1 small one outside in the main centre. There is 1 heated pool inside the Spa area. There is also a pool on the beach front; however was closed for repairs.  Entertainment: There was a wide range of entertainment. If you download the TUI Blue App, this gives you all the information and booking required.  The entertainment staff were fantastic, especially Rico, he was a great laugh and credit to the hotel. The activities included Darts, French Boccia, Golf, Water Polo/Volleyball/Basketball. There was a few activities I never did like the range of fitness classes and Sholjbeck.  OAB: There is 2 supermarkets outside the hotel, one on the left and one on the right. I recommend the one on the right. There is a spa which includes massages and treatments, there is a steam room which you have to pay for. You can exchange currency in the hotel UK Cash only. There is a camera man onsite, from who you can negotiate the prices of your printed pictures. For a guide, we paid £40 for 14 printed photos. The camera man is very friendly and approachable and you’re able to set a time in the evening with him for some evening beach photos.   Overall, highly recommended holiday and we will return!"

        "review_text": "So I am sitting on my balcony after a bit of changeable weather day. As my trip draws to an end I wanted to review this beautiful hotel. The building itself is lovely to look at and the reception area is clean and impressive.   The staff are all so friendly and genuinely look pleased to see you. They are attentive yet professional at all times. This would include front of house staff to cleaners and gardeners.  Cleanliness - the hotel is spotless you will see staff cleaning constantly the hotel smells amazing because of it. Our room kept pristine by Sonde our cleaner.  Pool area is large with one unheated pool and a smaller children's pool. The temperature is more than bearable with lots of people using it including myself. The infinity pool looks like there is improvement work being done so can't comment on use.  Food and drinks - I have been to many all inclusive hotels but I have to say this hotel offers choices many don't.  Fresh juice in the morning NOT from a carton also smoothie of the day. Again freshly made and included. The salads are amazing and to be offered steak and langoustines as part of buffet !!  A l a carte culinarium - one free meal within a week stay. Easy to book with Tui app.  4 course meal with lots of choice.   Spa - what can I say the highlight of my trip some of the best treatments I've had. Trust me I've had a lot. Hands down beats and cruise ship Spa and for a fraction of the price. Excellent packages offered you'd be mad not to take advantage of this.  All in all feel like I've had a wellness break and will definitely be back.  Well done TUI blue palm beach.!!"

        "review_text": "We have recently returned from a 10 day stay at the Tui Blue Palm Beach hotel in Hammamet, the staff were amazing with us and always polite.   We were greeted by friendly members of staff as soon as we arrived, who took our bags for us, and then seated us down for complimentary drinks as we filled in the paperwork for our stay at the hotel. We were then issued with our wrist bands, and informed that as we had arrived on an early flight, our room would be available after we had helped ourselves to some food and refreshments for lunch in the Main Restaurant.  The food, where do I start?  there was always a great selection of food on offer in the main restaurant, ranging from local foods, to a fully stocked salad bar 3 times a day , this included every morning freshly baked Croissants and pastries, and freshly made pizzas at lunch and evening meals. There are three Restaurant areas in the hotel, The Main Restaurant i have already described, The Snack Bar, Unfortunately we didn't get to try this, but i have read previous reviews that have said it is lovely, and then we have The Cullinarium, one word, WOW, the food here is another level, you can eat once here for free during your stay if you are All Inclusive, and any other time there is a charge, and it is best to book a table on the TUI Blue App when you are there. We visited the Cullinarium for my partners birthday during our trip and as i said, WOW, 4 courses, Drinks, breadsticks and dips on arrival, and the service was impeccable, they even sang Happy Birthday to my partner whilst putting a cake with a lit sparkler in front of her, its the little details that make such a difference.  The Accommodation was spacious with all the amenities that you would need ranging from a Mini Fridge, to coffee making facilities. the only thing missing was an iron and ironing board, but i am sure that the Reception would be able to assist with this. there is even a laundry service available for guests should they require this, which i think is a nice touch.  Entertainment was provided the entertainment team on a daily basis ranging from, Darts and French Boules, to Water Basket Ball and Water Polo. there is also a wide range of live entertainment in the evenings on a daily basis, all of which are very enjoyable.  A special shout out has to be made to Maha, Nothing was too much for her, anything from getting a fan for your room if it is too warm, helping you find the on site nurse, or helping you plan your next visit, should you wish to do so, and she was always willing to take the time to talk to the guests, and make them feel comfortable and happy during there stay.  Would highly recommend this hotel if planning a trip to Tunisia."

The entire staff are great and can't do enough for you and there's entertainment on the night with some fun activities in the day. The buffet restaurant always had a good selection of food on the go, they had mundane stuff like chips but also had local dishes with peppers, chillies, cuscus, rice and curries etc, they also did themed meals like Mexican where they made fresh tacos among other things and also had a great selection of puddings. So the bad points, which aren't so bad, the rooms were a little tired in places like the shower was a bit wobbly, just little bits and bobs really, our room had 2 single beds rather than a double, but this is nothing that would put me off or detract from the holiday experience."

Food in buffet and in a la carts restaurant was excellent and diverse (unless you’re vegan as the choices there are very limited). Thankfully I’m not vegan so had a lot of lovely meals there. Waiting staff were very attentive and I’d like to mention one of the waiters (Faycel) who made amazing efforts to look after everyone in his area of the restaurant and made people feel special when dining. Only negative for me was that there’s not much to see near the hotel so a taxi (or a walk) to Hammamet Old Médina was a must. The new Médina at Yasmin was not so good. We took the offer of a Sahara excursion and that was definitely worthwhile"

Big shout out to Ahmed who was there with a smile and a bottle of Rose or a beer at every glance. Animation team-excellent, really worked hard to involve everyone and all I'm going to say is \"silent disco\". If you know you know! Pool deck and beach were fabulous, but please provide sunbed mattresses for pool beds, beach and garden beds have them and my old creaking back would have sure benefited from one. The views from the lobby to the sea really does give you that wow sensation. This is one very good hotel with excellent staff!  Of course there can be some small improvements (hooks in the bathroom to hang towels please) and the aforementioned mattresses' for pool sunbeds, but these really are minor."

        "review_text": "My husband and I, daughter and 5year old grandson stayed 2nd May 25 for a week and we instantly regretted not booking for longer. We had two garden rooms which were lovely and cleaned daily. We were a little disappointed that the mini bar wasn’t replenished or even had soft drinks upon arrival and only water provided.  However, everything else made up for that.  Upon arrival Mayha escorted us to the restaurant to have lunch and showed us around, until our rooms were ready. Straight away we could tell the people made this hotel. Our grandson has severe coeliac disease (not able to eat gluten).  GF bread, pasta etc is extremely expensive in Tunisia. However they tried their very best to accommodate and we always found something for him to eat. We did take our own  GF bread & cereal  & snacks with us etc.   But there was a lot of choice for him. The chefs were amazing and so was our lunch and evening waiter, forgive the spelling but our waiter  Chadll and Karim were outstanding from that first lunch visit they memorised our drinks which were waiting for us at meal times.  Our breakfast waiter Ahmed (I think his name was the exact same) he also assisted us and opened up for breakfast early the morning of our pick up to the airport, so we could eat something. This was very kind and helpful. Thank you.  From life guards, security, cleaners, waiters, management and animation team all so  hard working staff, again unable to name you all, I can only remember Nino & Gorfy and the lovely lunatic who does the aqua HIIT and gym, simply amazing - thank you.   We did enjoy  a catamaran trip which was bought through the hotel for  £37 each ( no charge for 5 yr old) for half a day was lovely and it was safe.  We’ve already booked for next May but for 11 nights this time  and not 7, but we’ve opted for 2 sea view rooms next time as this has the sun on the balcony in the mornings which we liked.   The sea views do overlook the entertainment at night so if you go to bed early I’d pick a garden view.  See you soon and take care x"

        "review_text": "Stated at the hotel during May half term.   On arrival we were greeted by nice receptionist who asked for a print out of our reservation. Wasn’t interested in name on the reservation just the actual print out with booking reference number ( make sure you have this handy before travelling) we received the key and originally our room was allocated on a ground floor. Concierge followed us in order to show us the room and assist with bags, eventho we didn’t ask for assistance.   Once the door opened OH MY GOD ! the room stunk! Dirt was visible straight away on really min amount of furnitures, the bed sheet felt damp and the bathroom was crying for help! Absolutely disgusting 🤮   Went straight back to reception and ask for immediate room change as there was no way we could stay in that room for the whole week.  We have been offered another room, again the concierge followed us to show us the new room, nothing wrong with great customer service, however he didn’t want to leave the room unless tip was given ! New room was spacious with huge terrace overlooking the street - much better !   If you leave a tip for housekeeping staff - your room will have flowers on the bed and lovely fresh towels - if you don’t leave any tip - you will get bear minimum. However all housekeeping ladies we came across were always smiling and polite to us.   Following morning we went to get some breakfast and we have never came across a Buffett area where food is portioned by staff onto your plate.   If I have paid for all inclusive option, why am I getting only 1 piece of this and that and when asked for more the judgment on staff faces who “served” the food its unreal! We felt extremely uncomfortable wanting 2 eggs not 1 🧐 Food Options for lunch are “recycled” from the night before dinner, again food isn’t too warm by the time you reach your table.   We have noticed that if you tip staff at the beginning of your stay you will be treated differently than if you tip them at the end.  Some staff also pay more attention to those who are either regular guests or the ones who can give them more tip.   Entertainment team tries their best to keep everyone busy but timing for kids activities are all written in French and announced in French so we had to keep asking what time anything is happening so our little one could join.   Swimming pool and the slides are ok, however cleaning standards are not always good.  All staff speaks French, English is not very popular and all the announcements are done in French so often times, we didn’t know what was going on.   We went onto 2 different trips offered by a rep at the hotel - we had a great time however if you do decide to go for any extortion make sure you have cash on you - yet again it’s all about tips.   Overall experience - not great, more like a budget hotel with a pool - thank goodness weather was lovely.  Would we recommend staying here - nope but we will return to Tunisia 🇹🇳"

        "review_text": "We’ve just returned from a fantastic family holiday (2 adults, a 7-year-old, and a 15-year-old), and honestly, the hotel doesn't deserve the bad reviews it's been getting.  First of all, it’s important to be realistic. This is a developing country, and while it's rated 4 stars locally, that doesn’t mean it's the same as a 4-star hotel in the UK. But once you adjust your expectations and look at it logically, there’s a lot to appreciate here.  The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our stay. From reception to housekeeping and entertainment, everyone made a real effort to ensure we were happy.  Our room was cleaned daily, and fresh towels were always provided. The pools were clean and well-maintained, with plenty of space for the kids to enjoy themselves.  As for the food, there was a different theme each night, so we never felt bored with the options. Yes, the children’s food options were fairly similar most nights, but that’s quite common with all-inclusive packages. There was always something they could enjoy.  One of the real highlights for us was the entertainment team—they truly go above and beyond to get everyone involved and make the evenings fun.  Overall, we had a lovely time and felt well looked after. If you come with a bit of understanding and an open mind, you’ll have a great holiday too. Don’t let the negative reviews put you off.  Would you like me to tailor this for a specific platform like TripAdvisor or Google Reviews?"

The animation team? Good-humored machines! Always there to make us move, laugh, dance... Impossible to be bored, they assured serious 💯  Food level, nothing wrong: we ate well, it was varied and super good. And to recover after all that, the rooms were top: quiet, clean, and perfect for a good night's sleep (or a well deserved nap 😴).  And so... THE ZANZIBAR 😍! A crazy atmosphere, cocktails banging, good music, crazy laughs galore... we would have stayed there all night (actually, we did 😅).  In short, a week that we are not about to forget. We will definitely be back. And you, come as you are, but come quickly!"

As for catering, we feasted every day. Various meals, tasty, and for all tastes. Jean Zibar? An experience in itself! Awesome atmosphere, delicious cocktails, and evenings that we are not about to forget.  The rooms were comfortable, quiet, and we slept really well after busy days.  In short, a perfect week with friends, to do again without hesitation. Come as you are, you will leave with memories full of your head!"

The worst point is standing in the long lines for a pedestrian, let's look at this point because it was so annoying for my family and also for other families we know of the hotel so many of them destroyed and promised not to come back again. Last pay les matelas and even the scratch is really catastrophic, I recommend the adjustment is bad and not working, we also hope to review the prices compared to the quality of their servants is reasonable, and congratulations to every staff working at this hotel, please when you return if these remarks are taken into account and thank you."

Now I wonder how a guard at the entrance of the hotel has more prerogatives and decision-making power than the receptionist or the people of the hotel administration, I will leave you to answer me  For my part I do not hide my disappointment and frustration about this incident especially in the company of a foreign person of Russian nationality...

I had to pick up my things urgently and change rooms at 2:00 in the morning, which disturbed my sleep.  ❌ Full board, even bottled water is charged at an extra charge (4 dinars for a 1 litre bottle).  ❌ The quality of the food is poor, with little varied menus and almost identical every day.

The rooms are lovely and clean  beds are comfortable and if you need anything else just ask. The Animation team are great they try and get you involved as much as they can and also put on some great entertainment Djambo is brilliant Pika is great with the kids always shows enthusiasm Dali,Cam,Bilbo,David,Mimo and Rio are exceptional I cant praise them enough they maid our holiday. I do feel the hotel just need to add a couple of things to enhance a customer's experience I feel it would help customer's if all staff wore name badges as this would help to know who is serving you or even talking to you also a couple of pool tables and a dart board would be beneficial for just incase the weather isn't as perfect as all customer's want. Finally just a list visible on the bar of which cocktails are included in the All inclusive.  Finally the idea of being able to buy the t-shirts that the entertainment team wear is a great idea but feel that more colour availability for children would see sales rocket . Loved the whole holiday and looking at coming back next year ."

        "review_text": "Absolutely amazing hotel. We arrived at midnight after a long day travelling we was given a packed away meal each with 2 big bottles of water. The security guard took the big suitcase up and showed us our room. We had a 2 bedroom family room with a closing door between them plenty of space for us and all our clothes for a family of 4. It was clean We just jumped into bed. We got up the next day and exploded the hotel. We was amazed how good it actually was so much better than we expected. The entertainer team. Were fantastic they worked early till late always had a smile on their faces and always interacted with every one there no matter age sex or nationality. All of them was amazing but want to give a big thank you to Dali, mimo, djambo and pica . The bar staff round the pool and in the bar once again amazing always smiling always making sure you got your drinks and took the empty glasses. Again a massive thank you to aan called houssem for making us feel like royalty, for finding us and making sure you came over greated us by our names and made sure we was ok, and continued to make sure throughout the day amazing customer service. At lunch and dinner we always went to the same man skundra he was polite greated us with a smile, he was happy wanted to talk to his guests when appropriate, so not while we was eating. We got into the restaurant and had drinks ready and waiting he realised we drank the same each meal again very good customer service. The hotel is very clean and cleaned daily throughout the day, there was a storm one night we was there operation clean up began in the morning by dinner time came it was clean once again people using the pool and sun beds.... To get such a big outside space cleaned so fast I was impressed. We booked day trips with the men sat outside the doors under the shade by the restaurant windows, again they was brilliant wasn't pushy we said no at first but then the next day we discussed going out on the quads and camels so we booked with them and paid them the coach arrived bang on times given and took us to our activities. Both activities were amazing and well worth the money paid (, which compared to UK was cheap) we even booked to go on the quads again and the quad man took us somewhere different to explore Tunisia and even stopped and got a coffee on the ways back.... Again amazing customer service from all involved with the days out. There is a massive shop with everything you could think of inside it. We normally have to leave a hotel to find what we need but this time everything was there. The ladies and the men in the shop again had brilliant customer service, always happy smiling and always helpful. Your part of the beach is cleaned very well and kept nice for your guests. There is security walking about all day and night making sure you are safe and not bothered by anyone. Again they tried to talk to us but there was a language barrier however even tho we didn't know what eachother was saying it was a happy conversation and could see he was really trying. Overall we have had an absolute amazing holiday at this hotel and we normally like to try new places every year but I think we need to return to this hotel next year as it's been that good. When we left I emailed the hotel directed to the manager letting him know how happy we were and to thank them personally, again not something I usually do but felt I had to, who surprisingly messaged me back thanking me for my email, again good customer service. We love you guys and we will hopefully see you next year. Thank you for a good holiday once again."

Food is alway hit and miss at all inclusive at this hotel there is something for everyone, food was fresh and hot every day, i wasnt to keen on brekfast but thats my personal opinion. The rooms was spotless cleaners work very hard, i must say every part of this hotel was spotless, no fighting for  sun bed there was more than enough for everyone. Day entertainers amazing speak to everyone every day, didnt see the evening entertainment as kids show doesnt start until 8.30 so i would of left the bar by then. On site shop is good to pretty much all you need."

        "review_text": "My partner and I were always skeptical looking at Tunisia for a holiday but nevertheless we wanted to go and chose Paradis Palace for our hotel.   Straight off the bat when arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed like family by the reception staff, they told us our room is not ready yet which we imagined would be the case as it was 11:45am when we arrived but told us to leave our cases in the baggage area and go and relax with a drink. So we did just that.   This is when we met Assadene (apologies if I have spelt wrong) who came over, shook my hand and my partners, asked us what we would like to drink and went to fetch it. Straight away some great service me or my partner have not really experienced. Once those drinks were done he came back asked if we would like another, and another and this was the routine for the week to be fair, never having to leave the sun bed for a drink and waited on all week was amazing.  Moving on to dinner time where we also met Wassim and Rabia, two waiters who again, made everything special for us. It was my partners birthday on the friday so a cake was made and personally delivered to a table laid out with purple petals, swans made out of towels and candle in a glass. At no point did I ask for this to be set out and Wassim had done this to make the experience all the best.   The pool area was great, WiFi all around so I could listen to songs and my partner can download extra books on her kindle. Of course there was the animation team who were very enthusiastic to get you up and do stuff, my only advice is if someone has said no to archery 4 times in a row they probably arent going to do archery if you ask them again, I get it, it's their job but I just want to chill and if i want to join in I will.   The room was clean, brilliant as we had a free upgrade to the pool view room which was convenient next to the lift right at the front of the hotel. The cleaners would make little decorations out of the towels which was a nice touch.   Overall this is the first time in a while where I keep thinking that we should've booked 2 weeks and not 1 as I did not want to leave.   I would like to thank everyone at Paradis Palace for their amazing service and yes we definitely will be back in the future. Tunisia is up there as one of my go to places for holidays now and you are all the reason for it."

The staff at the bar and restaurant are very attentive, always smiling and very professional. The cleaning team does an impeccable job: the rooms and common areas are always clean and well maintained. The pool and beach team is very vigilant about our needs: mattress and umbrella.  A big crush also for the whole animation team, always full of energy, good humor and who does not lack ideas to animate aperitifs and evenings. A special thank you to Yacine, who is really exceptional: friendly, welcoming and always ready to make the holidaymakers have a good time. Many thanks to Sabeur who is always available to answer any question and give us the best advice to have a good stay and who is always concerned about our well-being.  Thanks to the whole team for this great experience, we recommend this hotel without hesitation!"

The whole experience for me, as a single woman travelling alone, is completely spot on. Aziza, see you next year (or I may even return in September this year)."

        "review_title": "Beautiful Views and Great Hospitality, but Let Down by Dated Facilities and Missing Amenities",
        "review_text": "Our stay at Hotel Aziza Thalasso Golf in Tunisia offered a mix of memorable moments and some frustrating inconveniences. The biggest highlight was undoubtedly the view from our high-floor room — the sea view was spectacular, and watching the sunrise over the bay at 5am was a truly magical experience worth waking early for. The beach area was pristine, peaceful, and far quieter than the poolside, where music plays throughout the day. It was reassuring to see a security guard on the beach, and although vendors occasionally approached us, a firm “no” was enough to turn them away.  We were always able to find available sun loungers both around the pool and on the beach, which made relaxing easy. The pool itself was a real treat, especially during the heat of the day, with a deep end of over 2 meters and a daily aqua fit class led by Jamal from the animation team — a popular and energetic session. The music at the pool added a vibrant ambiance, and parasols provided much-needed shade.  Dining at the hotel was a pleasant experience overall. The buffet offered a good rotation of different cuisines each day, and we never struggled to find something tasty to eat. The à la carte restaurant was fantastic — the food was delicious, and the menu changed daily, offering a welcome alternative to the buffet. Special mention must go to Cookie, James, and Shedley, who provided consistently excellent service and went out of their way to make every meal feel special. They are a credit to the hotel.  Our room was comfortable, well-equipped with amenities like a safe, hairdryer, and TV, and we consistently had good nights’ sleep. The pub on the lower level of the hotel added a homely touch, especially for guests wanting to watch live British football games — they even opened early to accommodate major matches. We also enjoyed Cafe Maure, a charming Tunisian-themed café where we had traditional mint tea and coffee, and tried a shisha pipe. The staff member there was very attentive and made the experience feel authentic and relaxing.  However, several aspects of our stay were disappointing. The most significant issue was the lack of air conditioning in the room — we were informed it wouldn't be turned on until mid-June, despite very warm weather. We were told to keep our balcony door open for ventilation, but this resulted in a room full of sand flies and mosquitoes. Although we were eventually provided with a fan, the lack of AC during hot weather is not made clear on the TUI or hotel website — it only appears in a small note within the booking terms and conditions. We are raising this separately with TUI.  Other maintenance and comfort issues also detracted from our stay. The WiFi in the room was patchy at best, although coverage improved near the lobby and pool. Power sockets were placed awkwardly around the room — none by the bedside — and the bathroom fixtures were in poor condition. The sink and toilet seat were cracked, and the sink plugs didn’t work, making it impossible to fill either the basin or bath. The shower screen did little to prevent water from flooding the bathroom floor, and the shower head was covered in limescale.  The bed was quite firm and may be uncomfortable for side sleepers. There were small but persistent oversights — no teaspoons provided with the in-room coffee facilities or in the restaurant, sunbed cushions that constantly slipped due to not being secured, and a noticeable lack of deep cleaning in the room, with dusty surfaces and tired furnishings.  The hotel overall is showing signs of wear and tear. The lower floors in particular look dated, with old, slow lifts and uninspiring décor (a dusty pinball machine tucked away in a corner sums it up). Hallway carpets are rucked in places, paint is in need of a refresh, and several lights in the buffet area were out, which gave a slightly neglected feel.  Lastly, it’s worth noting that the hotel charges 20 TND to hire towels — not a huge amount, but a detail that guests should be aware of in advance.  In summary, this hotel has a lot of potential: the location is excellent, the views are breath taking, and many of the staff go above and beyond. However, a lack of transparency around key amenities like air conditioning, combined with dated infrastructure and inconsistent room maintenance, took away from what could have been a five-star experience. With some updates and better communication, this could easily become a top-tier resort."

So I spent 7 catastrophic nights because of the heat and mosquito invasion as the window was open. The cleanliness of the hotel is really limiting and everything is old. I don't know who gave them the 4 stars but the hotel really doesn't deserve them.  I would not recommend this hotel at all! is much better in hammamet. I'm not coming back!"

        "review_text": "SCOTT E  I presume you were talking about the group of 6 - 8 adults who after riding the inflatables on the beach returned to the pool after 5pm once the pool bar had closed and most guests had returned to there rooms to prepare for there evening meal etc,  That the said group of adults decided to have some fun in an otherwise deserted area.  In case you had forgotten how to do so it is called having fun on your holiday - i would suggest you try it sometime - you never know you might just like it !!!!  NOW ON TO AN ACTUAL REVIEW OF THE HOTEL ITSELF   The staff are all amazing and nothing is to much hassle for them to ensure you are having a great holiday.  Rooms are a little dated as is some of the exterior but you need to remember you are in north Africa and money is not as free flowing as we have it back home.  Maintenance work was ongoing to the hotel as i witnessed first hand 2 employees scrapping and repainting the rear of the building to make it look welcoming to all future guests.  The food is also lovely with an A la carte restaurant  with different themed dishes served.  we will return to the hotel that is for sure as we enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend to anybody."

        "review_text": "The hotel and facilities are lovely overall. As others have said, it needs a bit of tlc but that all comes at a cost inevitably passed on to the guest. It's not luxury but neither is the price. The food was all excellent. No pork products are served.   The highlight is the pool area. It's lovely and peaceful which the majority embrace. Sadly, one squad of overfed, sunburnt and drunk British goons decided to ruin everyone's peace and quiet by screaming and bombing the pool for an entire afternoon.  The hotel is adults only, but some children never grow up.   Nobody from the hotel stepped in, which would have been nice.   This was certainly the exception though and the majority of the time it was lovely and calm. Jamil and Daniel from the Animation team were very pleasant. Encouraging but not pushy and two really interesting guys, full of local tips.   The beach area immediately adjacent to the hotel is kept really pristine. Sadly though, anywhere on the beach not outside a hotel is filthy with rubbish, bottles, half rotten cans etc. It's really yucky and it would be nice if the hotels clubbed together to have it cleaned up.   Nabuel is worth a taxi ride (£5 e/w) is you like the full Tunisian Medina souke experience. It's wild with hassle and haggling. You need to have your wits about you, but it's a lot of fun. If you prefer your shopping a little more serene, there's a great shop outside right of the main gates, just past Marco Polo. The owner is a gem, and all the prices are fixed and great value. They sell everything you find at the market and more.   If you go left outside and walk around 30 minutes following the coast and cemetary, you'll find an old fort and Medina surrounded by o a lovely harbour and restaurant area."

        "review_text": "Stayed for 7 days in May with my partner. Hotel is ideal for an all inclusive relaxing poolside holiday in the sun. Whilst the facilities and the rooms at the hotel are somewhat dated and due a modern update/refurbishment (air conditioning in the room works but is mediocre at best), the staff were amazing and went above and beyond to ensure all guests were happy.   The pool is lovely and very well maintained - with a pool bar that serves beer, wine, cocktails and soft drinks.    The hotel is right on the edge of the sea, which is ideal if guests feel they need a change of scenery from the pool.   The food was really good and exceeded expectations. All diets are catered for. Me and my partner never left breakfast, lunch or dinner feeling hungry.   All guests were civilised and polite to staff.   FYI: Tipping is a BIG aspect of the culture in Tunisia due to low wages. Be prepared to bring cash to exchange to Tunisian Dinar on arrival (Dinar is a closed currency and cannot be purchased outside of Tunisia)   A brilliant stay. Would recommend."

        "review_title": "Decent hotel in a lovely area, friendly staff but two awful experiences that let it down",
        "review_text": "Me and my fiancé visited in May 2025. My main commendation immediately is that the vast majority of staff are so lovely and helpful and will always be happy to help. You do run into the occasional issue with the language barrier with most of the staff speaking primarily French, but they’re always willing to listen and will understand eventually if you’re patient. The hotel itself is nice but could possibly do with some refreshing in areas. The food in the buffet restaurant was really nothing to write home about, and the ‘barbecue’ as they call it by the pool isn’t even almost a barbecue (could be a language difference), as what they offer is sandwiches, pizzas and salads. We had one night in the al a carte restaurant which was a nice change and was lovely. We spent every night in bar downstairs as the entertainment in the lobby was a bit boring to us and felt more tailored to older people, but the barman at the pub was absolutely brilliant and so lovely and remembered us every night. The karaoke and bingo nights were the best we had there and really brought it to life.   The main gripes I had was with the treatment from two specific people at two separate times. The first was with what seemed to be the manager of the main restaurant. We showed up for lunch at 2pm, knowing that it shut at 2:30 because we just wanted to grab a little something and go and we knew it wouldn’t take us that long. As we walked in, the gentleman (older man with a long tie) came over to us and checked his watch, telling us ‘its 2pm’ and we explained we knew that but we wouldn’t take long and he said ‘okay you can have 10 minutes’. I then let my partner go up first so I didn’t have to leave my phone on the table and the man came up to me and said ‘you need to go and get your food’ and I said ‘I know sorry I’m just waiting for him’ and he ushered me up and told me ‘no you need to go now please go now’. Then when we were eating he kept circling back to us and checking his watch. Keep in mind we weren’t the only people there, and other people were mindlessly browsing the buffet for second servings and not being rushed at all. Every night we saw him going forward it seemed he was trying to dictate what we did, with us going for opening time for dinner (7pm) one night and him telling us ‘wait 5 minutes before you get up’ after we sat, which none of the other tables were told to do.   My second issue was with the older lady in the Thalasso spa. We went for the one day treatment which involved sauna, exfoliation, seaweed treatment, jacuzzi bath and a massage to finish. The jacuzzi and massage were both lovely, however the woman we dealt with for the exfoliation and seaweed was absolutely awful to me. I believe a part of it was language barrier which is completely understandable, but when I didn’t understand or do exactly what she wanted she got physical with me. I had a bikini top on that needs to be taken off over head, which she forcefully pulled off me and ripped over my head exposing my chest which was very embarrassing for me. I asked her to avoid where I had sunburn when exfoliating my chest and legs, which she only avoided my chest and really hurt my legs. When I leaned up to ask her to avoid them she pushed my head back down and stuck her finger in my mouth by accident. After the seaweed was applied she directed me back to the sauna (which was shared with other people as they arrived) and when I tried to grab my bikini top she refused to let me and pushed me toward the door. I had to sit in the sauna exposed completely. It was embarrassing and infuriating. I felt like I was being punished the whole time I was in her care and it was horrible. I absolutely wouldn’t recommend the spa purely for her involvement in it.   These two experiences were such a shame because otherwise we had a lot of lovely days there. All in all if you avoid the spa and just figure out what you do and don’t like to do, its a nice little holiday place."

        "review_text": "This hotel has prohibited any modest swimwear; so if your chest and legs aren't on show regardless as to which gender you are - you won't be allowed to use the pools. There is an explicit ban on burkinis which is not stated on their website so it's not until you arrive that you find out.  Besides that, the hotel staff went above and beyond to accommodate us and make us feel welcome regardless - even upgrading us to a sea view room for free which was awesome. However, who wants to go on holiday and not enjoy the pools? So we had no choice but to check ourselves into another hotel.  The staff in all sectors are amazing. The food was nice but repetitive, the grounds are very nice too and clean.   If they'd just remove the ridiculous discriminatory ban on modest swimwear, I would happily stay there again"

        "review_text": "The hotel is showing its age and a little tired in places (rucks in the carpet, lift buttons don’t light up), but what it lacks in appearance more than makes up in character. This is credit to the fantastic team of hard working individuals that have gone out of their way to make our stay welcoming and enjoyable. We arrived around noon but were fed well before being shown to our room. The room was spacious and clean with a balcony overlooking the pool and beach. The food (bearing in mind that they are catering in mass) was full of variety with something for everyone and an opportunity to try something new, which we did. You might need to wait a few minutes for your omelette in the morning (cooked on the spot) but well worth the wait. The BBQ area was ‘sold’ as snacks when actually it was a sit down and served by self acclaimed best waiter in Tunisia nicknamed 007, with a choice of a baguette with a sliced burger or pizza which was a bit disappointing and we opted to have our meals in the main restaurant. Tipping is optional but recommended. We left 10 dinar for lunch and again at dinner. Coffee in the rooms is limited and will need to ask for more, cold milk is available from the bar. Nothing it too big an ask, and if not possible, explained softly with a kind smile. Really can’t fault the friendliness and welcoming hospitality. Despite reading reviews, overlooked taking enough papers for rolling tobacco. Reception booked us a taxi and we ventured to the local tobacco store. Luckily they had papers (at £1 a pack!) . There is a gift shop at the hotel and local trades people will call out along the beach in an effort to sell their stock. It would seem they are not allowed to approach, you need to approach them. I fell for that trap on our first day trying to be polite, so unless you’re ready to part with your cash, don’t!! Towels are available at a daily charge/deposit, we brought our own. There is a lovely gem of a shop near the hotel. Come out turn right, it’s just beyond the Marco Polo restaurant on the left and although only inflatables displayed outside, inside 3 floors of leather bags, sandals, pottery and clothes. If you didn’t bring mugs with you (the cups provided are tiny) then this is a good place to start! Prices are fixed and they will even accept £ if you don’t have enough dinar. They speak excellent English and are friendly but not pushy. We are looking to book again for the same time next year. So my top tips: bring a jar of coffee, mugs and teaspoons, rolling papers and if you can afford it, pay up for private transfers to and from the hotel, the VIP lounge at the airport which gives you comfy sofas while you wait, unlimited access to tea/coffee, soft drinks, snacks and sandwiches. You get red carpet (literally) check in and accompanied through passport control and security, right up to the gate. The airport only has one coffee shop which according to a review here, charges €12 for a coke! Hope you enjoy the hotel as much as we did"

Then 10 mins and tea to cool off a bit, then on to WONDERFUL 50 mins massage, courtesy of the very talented Maram and Naziha. Both were truly excellent and provided exactly what we wanted, pressure wise etc. I have an injury to my arm, and Maram handled it beautifully- massaged, but carefully and thoroughly.

        "review_text": "Hello, I don't understand how anyone could give this hotel 100%. I no longer recommend it to my enemies... We were there 1 year ago and it was a disaster !!  I haven't had anything worse in 5 stars yet. After about 35 x Turkey and 25 x Egypts I can certainly make a judgement. Despite about 100 USD Bakshish a week, we were treated as unwanted persons.  The occupancy was about 90% local guests , who fought at the buffet like it was the last meal and then the 50% just left at the table.. There was only 1 pool where our women could swim in bikinis, otherwise everywhere screaming cheeky kids playing a football in the reception without anyone having any regard for the other guests..    I could write for a long time, but there's no point.  The locals are there in your country and should do what they want - they are there at home .  But please do NOT recommend this hotel with top marks to people from D, A, CH, PL, CZ, SK who are not used to this."

We were smiling and laughing from the day we arrived to the day we left. We didn’t want to go home. All of the staff here are so friendly and helpful, the animation team were incredible and entertained our 2 little girls to make sure they could have the best holiday and us mums could relax too.  We are SO grateful for every single person in the animation team for making our holiday special, they are such an amazing team. The entertainment in the evening was so much fun, dancing, quiz’s, different games, karaoke and shows from outside the hotel.  There is different music by the pool all day so it’s good because you can listen to different types of music when sunbathing and not just the same thing. The food and drinks were great too, there is a different selection of Tunisia food and English food, something for everyone. There is plenty of bars in the hotel to get drinks from and the beach and sea is beautiful, there is a bar on the beach which walks straight out, it was nice and quiet here. We can’t wait to come back and would highly recommend coming here whether you are a family with children / solo or couples. There is something for everyone. A huge thank you to everyone at this wonderful hotel! 🥰"

Sousse is a fascinating town, the archaeological museum is not to be missed and the fort (Ribat) is also worth seeing. In the wider area, El Jem is also very much worth seeing. The hotel is fairly clean and there is a pretty broad range of food on offer. Beef is regularly served but (unsurprisingly) never pork. Egg is very widely used (even in pizzas). The beach is sandy and the hotel has both indoor and outdoor pools. The outdoor pool even has waterslides. The best aspect of the hotel is its staff who are friendly, helpful and kind. Some entertainments were provided at 21:00 in the evening. There was a quiz, karaoke, dancing etc."

Couldn’t sit in the bar area due to cigarette smoke so had to sit in the foyer. We were there for 7nights and 5 of those  ended in fights even to the extent that as new people arrived a fight broke out and they refused to stay at this hotel. Food was uninviting so although all inclusive we had to eat out every evening. Pool area never cleaned so sat on sun beds surrounded by fag butts and dirty tables. Don’t even get me started on the so called beauty & Spa. This was a joke. Will definitely go back to Tunisia as the people were lovely but I would recommend giving this hotel a wide birth until they sort the whole place out."

The sheets on the table were hardly changed and looking dirty. The bathroom shower cloth was full of mould and the AC was not working. The curtains in the room needs washing as we daw blood stain and the chairs and tables in the balcony needs cleaning in fact we had to request a room change and lost our sea view room which we paid for.

        "review_text": "We recently stayed at the Royal Jinene again, and as always, the staff made our trip special. A huge thank you to Rami, Rayda, and Mr. Manager for their kindness and hospitality. They always go above and beyond to make guests feel welcome, and it really makes a difference. Rayda even arranged a lovely birthday celebration for my mom, which was such a thoughtful touch and made her day extra special!  The food has always been a bit of a challenge for me personally, but I managed to find something to eat each day. I have noticed that the quality has improved over time, and I appreciate the effort the hotel puts into making things better with each visit. There was a decent variety, and while not everything was to my taste, I never went hungry.  The kids' outdoor pool was being retiled during our stay, but thankfully, there was an indoor pool available. To be honest, this was actually a better option since the weather was still too chilly for outdoor swimming. The indoor pool was clean, warm, and a great alternative, so it worked out well for us.  One thing to note is that the animation team changes seasonally, so the experience with entertainment and activities can vary depending on the time of year. We’ve noticed this on previous visits as well, but it’s something to keep in mind if you’re expecting a specific level of entertainment.  Overall, we had another lovely stay at the Royal Jinene and will definitely be back again. The improvements each time we visit don’t go unnoticed, and we always appreciate the welcoming atmosphere created by the wonderful staff!"

        "review_text": "This hotel is run down and I can't think of a positive thing to write. Food always cold. Day snacks were very limited. Drinks selection was very limited as well. Local beer, and spirits were disgusting so I bought becks which was only 7 dinar, so about £1.75 a bottle. You can smoke inside the bar and reception area so of an evening they are extremely smokey. Rooms were tidied every day but the sheets were not changed and the AC in the room didn't work. We asked for a cot and were told we had to wait until the next day to get one, which we then had to chase up to get it. Stupidly loud flush on the toilet and the toilet roll holder was held together used a nail at each end to hold the toilet roll.  The restaurant food was always cold, other than the pizza that you could have freshly made so was then hot. However if you picked a slice of already made pizza then that was also cold. I made a cup of tea and by the time I got up to my room on the second floor it was cold. Hot choclate had no choclate in it. Be vigilant as well. One day they served a pan of spaghetti and a separate pan of bolognese. The restaurant manager came to my table offering a bowl of spaghetti bolognese already mixed. I never saw it myself but I can only assume that it was left over food from other people's plates as he was pushing round the trolley to collect the dirty plates. The table clothes were always dirty and not replaced after someone left the table. The cutlery and napkins were also never replaced so you had to go and take them off other tables, and the salt shakers were all dirty and never cleaned.  The outside was not busy so we had our choice of sun beds. The kids pool was closed as they were retiling it. The main pool slides were only on for about 1 hour out of the day. The pool bar did not serve becks so I had to go to the hotel bar everytime I wanted a drink. Internet was very hit and miss and I struggled to get service around the pool. They had table tennis and darts as entertainment in the day but the tennis court, the basket ball court and crazy golf all needed work and the crazy golf needed that much work you could not play it. The beach did have a beach bar, however it was shut. I wanted to take a bucket of ice with becks down to the beach on my last day but was told there was hardly any ice so I couldn't do that.  I did leave the hotel to go for a walk and the outside was very run down and smelt. The nearest supermarket was a 10 minute walk but as it was Ramadan you could not buy alcohol and any cafes and restaurants near by were all shut until late evening.  I would not return to this hotel and I've been put off Tunisia all together now."

For what we paid we actually thought it was okay. Rooms were always clean and tidy, food was okay with some choice, breakfast we didn’t bother and a few had said it wasn’t great but I can’t comment. Staff couldn’t do enough for you, the evening entertainment was always a laugh. I have to say, there was never a dull day, it was a bit like an episode of eastenders with some of the guests, but everyone chats to everyone and it’s generally a friendly atmosphere. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like the 4 and 5 stars were used too. But we would pay around £1200 each for that. We paid just under £400 total for 2 people and added on a case. I have to say for what we paid I really can’t complain."

        "review_text": "Solo travelers honestly don’t… I travel quite a bit and was excited as a female I stuck out like a sore thumb understandably due to the culture etc.  The restaurant and bar are limited, no cocktails, relaxing beside the pool or beach.  The advertisement photo is deceiving as it’s really the most beautiful wall to look at in comparison to the rest of the hotel.  Restaurant and bar area is like an old man’s club dim, fill of smoke and smelly. The room was standard, clean sheets, vanity table and a wardrobe but outdated. The hotel needs a face lift. Also, it doesn’t not a beach as stated except an extremely busy road so be careful! If you intend in booking keep in mind this is no a family friendly hotel it’s anything but.  Finishing on a good point is the location it’s between Yasmin and Hammamet but you’ll need a taxi."

The room was clean, with simple but sufficient comfort for a short time. Too bad there is no wifi, but it remains acceptable. The breakfast, although not varied, is quite correct and satisfying. The staff is very welcoming and friendly. It is an ideal choice for a stopover or a short stay. Thank you."

        "review_text": "The hotel is located about a 30-minute walk from Hammamet's city center and 15 minutes from the train station, making it a convenient base for exploring the city and its surroundings.  The rooms are clean and well-maintained, though the Wifi did not work despite being advertised as available in all rooms. The staff are polite and speak decent English.  As for food, breakfast is good, although the selection is somewhat limited. Several restaurants offering both local and international cuisine are nearby. There’s also a restaurant within the hotel that serves good food, which is a great option for those who prefer to stay in at night. Beer, wine, and other spirits are available at reasonable prices.  The swimming pool is clean and well-maintained, and drinks are served poolside, although the service can be a bit slow. The clientele is a mix of Europeans, Tunisians living abroad, and locals.  Verdict: While not exactly a peaceful retreat, especially on weekends, this hotel is an excellent base for exploring Hammamet. The price-to-quality ratio is good, and it is relatively affordable by European standards."

        "review_text": "Negative:  1) Very Noisy, I asked for a quiet room, I am put in a courtyard that is noisy all night with people who eat late at night and stay all night chatting 2) Wifi that does not work in the room even with an ORANGE prepaid package  3) the beach is small , crowded , you are on each other , no place and no privacy  4) the beach is filled with pebbles, it takes 100 meters in the water to get sand  5) flushing that does not work , no water in the toilet 6) Restaurant for Inn guests very small unlike the restaurant of outside guests who have a very large restaurant 7) At breakfast, the staff do not work , they always miss plates , they do not anticipate anything, they should always be asked to bring food , flagrant lack of space , instead of looking at the customers, the staff should work and see what is missing to restock the food 8) I asked for a tea, first it does not ask me what kind of tea I want, it brings me black tea , the one I hate , I prefer green tea to mint and the worst it is cold, it brings it to you without lid and to top it all off, the quantity is just a small glass . No mint tea in the morning. 9) Breakfast to be greatly improved whether at the level of staff or what is offered. 10) I arrive at 13:00 , the receptionist tells me 10 minutes for the housekeeper to make the room knowing that my room has already been booked , I waited 15:00 to have the room , these 10 minutes turned into 2 hours , he did not even offer me to leave the things and go to the beach especially since it was 40 degrees, I lost 2 hours instead of enjoying the beach, cleaning service far too long and inefficient and the worst on the day of my Check-out, the housekeeper arrives at noon to make the room , I would have wanted the day when I arrive that the housekeeper makes the room at noon and not at 15:00. Household too long  11) Too far from the center of Hammamet , 1 hour walk 12 ) Lack of staff smile , Impression of disturbing reception when requesting information 13) No information when we get there, hold the keys and manage   The positive:  1) Quite large room with a beautiful balcony 2) Breakfast with fruit and yogurt  3) Private beach with sunbed  4) Typically Oriental Pension with Maghreb Decorations , it looks like Marrakech Pension 5) A private swimming pool   Overall, it is quite mixed and average but it is a Pension that has potential if it is better managed."

Very noisy. We changed room 4 times for different reasons. My watch was taken on the 2nd day from our room. Some rooms do not have a safe and it was not explained that the safe is at reception. Food was awful we booked half board. We had to pay for water with our meals. Every evening you had an option of 3 choices and the same dessert every night water melon or honey melon. It says at the front of the hotel that there is security there isn't  wifi is difficult to get in most rooms. No entertainment as it states on the holiday advert. It also says there is a spa there is not. The pool was not very clean so keep your head above water. We all had stomach problems and had to buy medication. Please just book somewhere else."

Breakfast was included although nothing special it was fine. Reception were friendly and although I had to change my room this was no problem. The manager was very helpful in changing my room. The food is reasonably priced and u can get service to the poolside which was great too. There's a friendly lifeguard and helpful restaurant staff there. The rooms are adequate some perhaps bigger and quieter than others so ask for a quiet room as some rooms overlook the restaurant/bar courtyard below which comes alive with young Tunisias at night. All in all a very good attractive hotel with an excellent price and great pool. 👍"

Negative Limited breakfast no pastries just bread, tomatoes, cheese, jam, coffee luckily you have bakery and cafe next door... Far from the beach c the expedition to get there cross a road full of cars difficult to cross then take stairs then recross a road no pedestrian in short 10 minutes to get there c the weak point if you like the beach don't come here though if you like to party and drink this is the perfect place Bar for beer fans, lots of men, I don't recommend it for single women Or for 1 night or 2"

On the plus side, despite arriving early, we got a room around 10 without having to wait for the day to start. There is an exchange office on site, you can exchange dollars, euros and also pounds, yen or francs and Danish crowns. They have their own piece of beach and 6-7 positions with sun loungers. There is a small swimming pool. There is a restaurant on the patio, good prices, pleasant and very large portions. Breakfast I read a lot of opinions that it was a roll with jam. Today, however, there was cold meat, eggs, white ricotta cheese. , jam, yogurts, baguette, cucumbers, tomatoes, plain and chocolate croissants, and sand cake. Coffee, tea, orange and peach juice, very nice service. The downside is that we have a room above the patio and it is very noisy at night until 2:00, there is music, voices, it is a lively restaurant. Considering the price - a very good choice"

Rooms were cleaned every day, bed was decorated very nice way, but it was some dust on the furniture, there are put soap for us on the 4th day.  Hotel has excellent local, because it's on the main road and there is bus stop - buses to Tunisia, Yasmin Hammamet, Nubel and Medina are available. 2 roads needs to be crossed to go to the beach, it has sunbeds and sun umbrellas. Wather is  amazing  beautiful. I  recommend this hotel and definitely if I have a chance will visit again."

I'm staying there last two years, and I appreciate so much the development of the hotel. Many things are not changing and this is the positive side, many things changed in a good way and there is no negative side at all. For the people who just thinking to visit this hotel I wanna suggest you residence. The hotel is sittuated in a very good part of Hammamet, between the old center and not so far from Yasmine Hammamet. To get to the beach takes about 5 min by walk. Inside the hotel there is a small garden, pool and bar. Prices in the hotel not so big, I would notice that some things costs less then in other places. The food is really good, and tasty. The staff of the hotel is the best staff in the world! They are so kind, they can help you 24\\7 and they made my stay really great!  Thanks to all the people who work in residence! We love you so much and hope to see you soon!"

I would like to say a big THANKS to the all staff and the owner of the hotel. Since 1st time there , we are like at home in residence. All stuff there work many years, so they make the atmosphere there.  In brief about residence: The hotel isn't new, but the owner repaired rooms, reception and bar inside the hotel, so the hotel looks very light, style and very clean. You can walk without shoes everywhere. The rooms aren't big but very comfortable, clean and light and there are no same rooms in the whole hotel.  About food: Food is great. they make food very tasty, and sometimes one portion is enough for 2 persons. You can have a lunch as in the hotel (the price is absolutely acceptable) as outside in the cafes. There are many cafes next to the hotel, so there is no problem to eat smth.  As I wrote before, the staff of the hotel is amazing, I love each of them, they were taking care about us and all guests, they are friendly and very cute. They made everything, that I wish going there back asap.  The beach is near the hotel, about 5-7 minutes by walk, there u can find chairs, plank beds or pillows as u like. By the way in the hotel there is a small pool, where u can also stay to have a sunbath if u are lazy to go to the sea.  In the end I would like to say thanks to Mahmoud and the all staff of the residence that they made our staying so great and see u soon, I hope.  Your faithfully Anna S."

        "review_text": "20 minutes before getting our bus to the airport our bags were not where we left them ( in front of reception) where the receptionist said they would be safe. When we asked to see camera footage multiple times they declined and when we asked to have a written note that our bags were stolen or lost for insurance they said they can’t do that either. They just kept telling us to get on our bus and leave. All they did was time waste until we had to go unless we wanted to miss our flight. The picture is of the manager that didn’t help at all and actually hid in the back when he got caught with his lies and then proceeded to call my girlfriend a liar. I also have a 17 minute video on my phone of all the staff ignoring us and telling us to leave to the airport."

        "review_text": "On arrival we where made to wait the standard 3 hours for our rooms , this was a bit of a hassle , we where given a room on the Lower floor which I complained about and was moved the following day upstairs, the second room 269 was very good . It had been recently renovated and my holiday was great thereafter . The animation team work endlessly to make sure guests are happy and content . If you tell them no they accept it and move on , special mention to Tony what a man he is , also anime and mono are great :) doussa on guest relations is great fun and always stopped for a chat AYE  and yuseff in main buffet area was a fantastic waiter always had my table ready , anwar in the bar and the young boy on the beach bar where also great at topping up drinks. My only negative is I had to take my paperwork to the gym daily which was an absolute hassle . This should be free . I have stayed here twice now and with your staff being so good I would come back again . A little tip goes a long way in this hotel , anyone reading reviews it’s not five star you are absolutely correct but you don’t pay five star prices either .! Wouldn’t hesitate on using this hotel on my next visit tonight Tunisia which I hope to be soon"

        "review_text": "First of all being a small group tour operator myself and having worked with many operators and travel agencies for 8 years; I was very surprised by the negative reviews that do not correspond in any way to the reality of the hotel. The criticisms are unfounded. I am currently with my partner at the Royal Thalasso Monastir Hotel. The hotel is beautiful with a beautiful modern decoration and very nice.all the staff is kind and attentive. The service is impeccable on all levels. The rooms are comfortable and the cleaning is well done every day (with a small tip. , , you have all the attention). The setting is very nice and the outdoor pool is great, plus an indoor heated pool. The food is varied and delicious. There's really a choice. Fresh and pressed orange juice is offered. In other hotels, it is paid. The hotel offers a very peaceful setting for a relaxing holiday. It deserves these 5 stars by Tunisian standard. Special thanks to Mr chokri Atiri for his very warm welcome and for room 518 . Thank you very much. I highly recommend the Royal Thalasso Monastir. Make your own experience and beware of negative or misleading reviews. Mme Camaret Camille"

        "review_text": "Hotel room was large and clean- bathroom a little dated. 2x 1.5L water bottles replenished daily in the room. Walls are very thin and often woken by neighbors. Location- nothing near by, some water sports on the beach and a hotel further down with a shop inside. Take cash to change for dinar- won’t do this with card.  Pool area was nice, pool kept clean. Always enough sunbed both at the pool and the beach.  Animation team are lovely, always trying to get you involved however if you’re not interested do soon get the picture and leave you alone. Pool/beach bars didn’t have the largest selection of alcohol but we don’t drink much so wasn’t an issue for us. Soft drinks were branded, latte was nice.  Food was repetitive like most all inclusive however we always found something to eat and didn’t go hungry. Drinks were waiter service at lunch and dinner, again staff really helpful and always keeping drinks topped up. Staff were all very attentive, polite and always happy to help. We visited the spa for access only which was relaxing which cost about £25 for two people.  We went as a couple and wasn’t much entertainment for kids however this may be different in the school holidays. Some reviews are very negative on here but for the price we paid we did not expect the 5 star luxury we’ve had before where we have paid a 5 star price. If you remember that you won’t go far wrong, we had hot sunny weather, relaxed by a pool and didn’t have to cook and clean for a week for a very low price! So I can’t complain! We would return for a cheap week in the sun!"

        "review_text": "This hotel claims to be 5 star. It is not. Maybe many years ago it was good, but now it is run down and tired. So firstly I’ll praise the staff, the majority work hard, and are friendly, but like any large establishment there are exceptions.  Arrived about 12:00 lunch time tired and hot after 11 hours travelling. Hotel policy is they won’t book you in until 3pm. So you’re left sitting in reception for a further 3 hours.  Finally got room and paid extra for pool view. Not disappointed. Room however although cleanish is probably 20-30 years outdated. With bodge repairs (see bath photo as an example) next I take a shower, bath is filling with water and plug twist doesn’t work. I then have to unscrew bath plug and lift it. Water still doesn’t go so now I’m stamping trying to use my foot as a plunger over the hole and blockage clears. This is how we left it for the week. Every mornings around the toilet area puddles of clean water. Can’t suss where it’s coming from, but always cleaned by the very good room service.  Hotel location is isolated so it’s the hotel or nothing else unless taxi ride. You can walk to Monastir airport about 15 min for a shop at airport prices. Beach is disappointing, only just over one subbed wide, and that’s all the time. Tide doesn’t seem to make it bigger or smaller. Also not the best. Food is repetitive, and often just like warm, by the end of the week I was glad of chips and cakes. Drinks are super small, beer you can drink all day and night and it has no effect, it’s either super watered down or alcohol free. All other all inclusive stuff is local and equally tiny measures. I feel for the bar staff, there are some good people, but I was told by one member policy was not to serve all inclusive guests in larger glasses. Animation team work hard, but sometimes over the top. Public entrance and piano bar are ok, pool bar and beach bar poorly stocked and regular run out and run down.  Maybe a ploy to serve less, but just makes it look unprofessional and cheap. I stay in many hotels as part of my work, rooms are on a par with travelodge, functional but not much else, air conditioning blows but is ineffective, public areas maybe as good as premier inn. Entertainment although they try is to varying degrees. Karaoke standard to pub singers at best."

Always smiling and ready to help with everything. For the first time I was travelling with wheelchair and was worried that we will not manage. It was no need to. There was always a kind soul ready to help. I would like to thank people working at the pool and sea bar for all the support everytime we came there. Also animation team and pool lifeguards. I would also love to thank waiters in restaurant for making us feel welcome and special all the time. Dear management you have fantastic people working there. Food was excellent and hit my taste buds directly. Wide selection of meat, pastas, and salads etc. Room was nice and clean. We kept finding hearts and swans made of towels which we found cute. I would give 6 stars with ease if trip advisor allow that."

Prices for drinks both in and out of hotel is good.  Area on first appearance is run down but the New medina is 5 mins walk away and is vibrant with the added bonus of the Rovers Return, if you fancy a drink and chat with ex pats that run it. I’m told they do a good Sunday lunch if that’s your thing. Almost opposite the hotel is a local cafe, coffee, soft drink and excellent flat bread or panini’s £8 for 2. It’s not everyone’s choice but VFM it is excellent, we were HB not sure I would want AI."

When booking the holiday the travel agent told me that the full board plus was soft drinks with my meals, this suited me just fine! On arrival none of the staff helped me with my luggage! I was slightly earlier arriving for 2pm check in and I was told that I could go and get lunch in the hotel restaurant.....I had to pay for my lunch and my soft drink, and this left me pretty baffled as I was there on a full board basis!  I decided to ask the hotel manager (who was extremely cold & unwelcoming) what the full board plus entailed..... He told me that includes the use of the pool area, the restaurant, the gym! and all the hotels immensities! When I explained to him that I was told that the full board plus was all meals including sort drinks he dismissed the matter and point blank said that I would have to pay for any soft drinks, tea and coffee in the hotel!  This hotel is promoted as a 4* star hotel but is more like a 2*star at a push!   My bedding got changed once after I requested it be changed, my bedroom had many faults eg. Drawer cupboard bottoms sliding out! Door knobs hanging off, the hotel is badly needing a revamp, my balcony looked onto a wall, it was a terrible experience all around.  The morning came to check out and the nightshift staff were prompting me to tip them, but they had done nothing for me, and when I said that I had no money left, they said well you go outside and wait, I felt again extremely disappointed, and once again I got dismissed from the staff...... My transfer arrived to take me to the airport and no one helped me with any of my luggage to the bus.  This was my twelve time visiting Tunisia, I have always had a warm reception from the hotel staff, I have loved my holidays to Tunisia but my experience at the Florapark hotel was so sickening and disappointing that I'm not sure if I'll return."

There was absolutely no entertainment on offer, and the location is quite remote with nothing of interest nearby.  The food was another major disappointment. It was the same every day, with very little variety or excitement in the meals. It quickly became boring and unappetizing.  The one saving grace of this hotel was the staff. They were truly lovely — always polite, helpful, and doing their best to make guests feel welcome. It’s just unfortunate that the rest of the experience didn’t match their efforts."

        "review_text": "I booked this resort as single person as it was adults only.On arrival at 11 a.m I been told to wait till 2 p.m as checking in time is 2 p.m.I sat at the hotel bar waiting.Lunch started at 12.30 as I paid for full board I made my way to the restaurant but been told that I have to pay for lunch as on the first day I only can have 1 meal free.No free water or any beverages has been offered on arrival.Actually there was nothing free there even though I paid for full board.All drinks,coffee,water,soft drinks are payable.Room was very rundown and dirty, bathrooms covered in limestone and very smelly.Water pressure is not existent and hot water only runs for 5 min.Bed was extremely uncomfortable, very hard mattress and lumpy old pillows.Gym equipment was broken and it was basically a pile of metal parts,could only use Treadmill , weights starts from 8kg.I did complaint about gym conditions but nothing had been fix.So,there are no gym center. On the second day my toilet got flooded but it hasn't been fixed or cleaned properly so I had a smelly pond for the rest of the holiday. Oh, air-conditioning is a joke,it's makes a very loud noise but no cool air coming out. There are no cattle or tea / coffee making facilities,no iron so if you need to iron you have to pay for each piece of clothes which needs to be ironed. Cleaning is terrible,my floor hasn't been mopped for 6 days and bathroom was absolutely minging. TV has no English channels and no remote control was in the room. I had to pay deposit for pool towels. Food is absolutely terrible pretty much same every day,no fresh fruit or ice-cream,or tea.  People allowed to smoke inside. There was absolutely no entertainment of any kind in the evening so if you want some nice food and music you would have to go out. Big square beds by the pool didn't have nice curtains or soft padded covers ( as per advertised pictures)and frankly dirty. Oh,the beach...It is about 15 min for walk from hotel.Very dirty, neglected with old sunbeds.Beach Bar looked like an old garden shed,not shower or changing facilities, couldn't see toilet. Giving tips to staff would make no difference so don't bother. Overall after 6 days I had a stomach ache because of poor food,back pain because of very uncomfortable bed and couldn't wash my hair properly because of poor water pressure.I was very close to leave early as I had very bad experience. On my last night I could sleep at all as some Arabic speaking couple had a mad domestic for hours upstairs but no hotel staff attended to find out what is going on. Please don't waste your time and money. Do not believe pictures,you will be very disappointed."

        "review_text": "The room is gross, already there are 2 glued beds instead of a large double bed , at the reception they told us we had to offer this when booking! Knowing that we went on our honeymoon, the sheets were dirty , the pillows were padded with sponge , there was no duvet on the bed and the towels do not talk about it! We went to the reception to claim they told us to go to dinner first! And at the surprise restaurant... there was a mouse that was quietly walking around! The worst part is that when we told them we weren’t believed accusing us of wanting to cause trouble"

        "review_text": "First impressions were lovely but all was not as it seemed.    Cons: 1) Hotel rooms were run down: 1a) latch / handle on sliding balcony door was hanging off so couldn’t secure the room.  1b) air conditioning was ineffective and did not output cool / cold air, only circulated warm air from the room (it was colder outside and more effective to open the balcony door for cool air).  1c) room cleaning was poor / non-existent. It seems the cleaner only made the bed and partially replaced dirty bath towels I.e. two dirty towels taken away but only replaced with one clean. Empty toilet roll not replaced so left with none.   1d) bedding wasn’t changed during a 5 night stay.   1e) telephone in room did not work to call reception with issues.  Communal areas: 2) suffocating toxic smell for 1 day in all corridors, lobby, stairwell and lift - possibly white spirit or similar. Staff were unable to explain what it was other than someone decorating (although there were no signs of workman decorating or freshly painted areas). This was exceptionally unpleasant and if it was from decorating this should not have been completed whilst guests were staying.  3) Pool music was obnoxiously loud to the point where even putting in head phones and listening to music at maximum volume couldn’t even drown out the pool side music. We were forced to listen to it whether we wanted to or not!  4) the hotel rule of ‘no food or drink from outside the hotel to be brought into the grounds’ was not communicated to us at check in. This rule applied even for us on a half board package and we only discovered this after visiting a nearby shop and on return our purchases were confiscated at the gate. We were told to speak to reception who did not apologise for not informing us and made no effort to resolve the issue.   During our stay we also heard other guests discussing their same negative experience.  5) very little variation in evening meals, it always contained the same dishes with perhaps one or two variations from evening to evening. All dishes lacked flavour and very bland.  6) return transfer collection was absurdly early. The hotel is 35 minutes from the airport, we were the final pick up and our pick up time was 5:55am (but had to be outside 15 minutes early). The bus arrived at 5:40am and we arrived at the airport at 6:15am (4 hours before our flight and 1 hour before check in opened). This was hugely unnecessary.   Pros: 1) Entrance lobby and pool looked were lovely and well kept."

        "review_text": "Lets start with the good - flights and transfer were fine. First impressions of the hotel was good. Staff were friendly and loungers by the pool were comfy. Breakfast was nice too - The chef had great humour and I had a omelette most days. If you don't like eggs, you were pretty stuffed though.   Hotel room - Broken balcony door (how this has not been fixed I do not know) - we could have asked to change but we had unpacked by the time we realised. Air con worked but wasn't cold, just blew out room temperature air, even though it was on the coldest setting. We went in May so I can only imagine how hot the room would get any other time of the year. Then the shower, if you can call it that. Hot then cold whenever it felt like it and next to no pressure at all. It was laughable.   Food - we were half board. As mentioned breakfast was ok! Dinner though, very bland. Same type of food every night. I lived off rice! We decided to go out one night but found the same - very very bland. Cocktails also not good.  Pool - nice pool but what really let it down was the volume of the music. The hotel has a member of staff just to sit and do the music all day. Mixture of music but so loud, unnecessarily loud. If you wanted peace - yeah, good luck!  Area - As a whole I was not impressed. Very dirty, beaches also had litter everywhere. Because of this we decided not to have a beach day.   With the rules on their currency it meant we had to get money out there. I would really recommend taking cash out with you and exchanging it. Unfortunately we didn't do this and had to find a ATM. If we had the cash originally the hotel would have exchanged it there and then on check in.   Everywhere you go people are always trying to get your attention. Friendly, yes but its always to con you into buying something. I really felt the pressure from everyone and in the end, we ended up being a bit rude telling everyone no thank you and not stopping to chat.   We made the best out of the holiday but overall, I would not return not only to the hotel, how its a 4 star I will never know but to Tunisia. Shame. I hope writing this will help others as I would have loved to have known this beforehand."

        "review_text": "May I address this complaint to you following my arrival today at your establishment. From the moment I arrived, I was disappointed by the reception and the condition of the room. Indeed, many essentials were missing, and the room lacked life and comfort. In addition, I had to search my room alone after the receptionist simply pointed me in the direction, without any assistance. The road was long, and outside my bedroom door there were mattresses stored, which gave the impression of neglect. Regarding my full board reservation, it is clearly stated that I should benefit from three meals per day. Having arrived at noon, it would have been logical for me to start with lunch, and for my stay to end with breakfast on the day of my departure. However, the receptionist informed me that I had to start with dinner, which does not meet the conditions. Finally, I would like to point out that the internet connection (wifi) in my room is of very poor quality, which is particularly embarrassing.  Thank you for taking my complaint into consideration and making the necessary corrections. As you await your return, please accept, Madam, Sir, the expression of my distinguished greetings."

        "review_text": "We stayed 10 nights, very disappointed,  in need of refurbishment,  public areas are clean, rooms not so much, reported several complaints to reception, all dealt with quickly. All fittings need replacing,  taps very difficult to operate,  shower tap broke off in my hand.all drains blocked.  Water leaks from shower. Several lights not working . No tea/coffee making  facilities in the room. Provided after several requests,  two cups ,a few tea bags, no coffee ,sugar ,milk or spoons. Purchased from local shop. Hotel discourages guests from bringing in food and drinks also water. Good selection of food,  buffet style.most of it was barely warm, mostly cold. Good selection of fried eggs and fresh omelette made to order.  Coffee provided for breakfast was served from out dated machines Luke warm and tasted terrible Microwave is provided in the restaurant to heat the cold food, but was not functional  All Inclusive is a joke, one bottle of water provided with evening meal. All other beverages must be paid for at all times Bar man under served spirits, when queried ,denied it aggressively.  We ate out several times at various restaurants , all very poor quality. Over all very cheap holiday if that is your only requisite  ideal if you want to spend every day by the pool and tan. No real activities in the area, not even descent walks The entire area is just Hotels. Shopping is shocking experience. All shopkeepers try to rip off tourists, we witnessed several horrendous transactions Benidorm is a million times better, not that we would return there. We will never return. We are seasoned travelers.  This was our worst experience. Go at your peril"

        "review_text": "We arrived on Wednesday to stay for a week full board and changed our flight home to Friday staying just 2 nights.  I booked this trip with my 20 year old daughter with an open mind, having visited Tunisia twice before but many, many years ago so we weren’t expecting Benidorm or Greece!  The hotel is nice, not fantastic, it’s fairly old and the rooms and facilities are tired, albeit spotless.  The staff were in the main friendly, bar a couple of extremely miserable ones!  This hotel however is clearly mainly for Tunisians and definitely not for Westerners, even though it was an EasyJet package holiday, we felt quite intimidated by this and felt very out of place and uncomfortable especially at meal times.  We had got dressed for a nice meal only to end up sitting in a jacket at the dinner table to avoid the stares. The restaurant was more like a canteen and ambiance non existent.  The bar sadly allowed smoking and Tunisians smoke a lot.   The food wasn’t great although looked the part with lovely looking salads etc it was all very tasteless and the hot buffet was only just warm, cold in some cases.   The other guests took huge plates full of food to their tables, especially the desserts, and proceeded to pick over this and leave what they didn’t want, which quite frankly the waste was incredible but never questioned, despite the management having signs requesting “you can take what you like but eat what you take!” The buffet was not replenished so if you didn’t get there early then you got what scraps were left. We didn’t go to dinner on the 2nd day nor breakfast, we bought crisps & biscuits from the shop to avoid putting ourselves through that again.   On the first night, at midnight our hotel room door was tried several times, it could have been mistaken room identity (although the numbers are clearly marked) but it frightened the living daylights out of me and I’ll be honest we really didn’t feel safe.   We are completely gutted that our Mother/Daughter week away was cut short, no complaints were made because what were we to complain about, it just wasn’t what we expected, if you are looking to spend your holiday with the locals then go for it.  As the currency is closed we exchanged money at reception when we arrived but as no receipt was given (make sure you ask for one) they wouldn’t change our money back so we had to try and spend it all at the airport, before going through passport control.  Not something I generally have a problem with but it’s just tat and crap souvenirs!!  Be prepared to tip everyone, they will wait or ask for a tip in whatever you do even the bus driver who wouldn’t load or unload our suitcases."

In the room, everything was perfectly cleaned, from freshly changed sheets to sparkling bathrooms. It was felt that the staff attached great importance to the maintenance and hygiene of the establishment.    Kitchen:  The service of the staff, especially the waiters, was impeccable with remarkable attention to every detail and constant concern for the well-being of the guests.  Food is a shame because cooking is an important part of my hotel experience. I hope the property will be able to review its culinary offerings in the future to offer more diversity to its guests. This would greatly improve the overall quality of the stay.  the host of the Rami Hotel:  was one of the highlights of my stay. With his overflowing energy and communicative enthusiasm, he has created a friendly and entertaining atmosphere within the hotel. Its varied activities and activities allowed all guests, young and old, to spend pleasant moments and relax fully.   His organizational skills, creativity and ability to put people at ease were particularly appreciated. Thanks to him, the hotel was not just a place to stay, but became a real place to live and share.   I will have an excellent memory of this outstanding host, who contributed greatly to the success of my stay. His professionalism and good humor were a real plus for the overall hotel experience."

The hotel’s location was unbeatable—right by the beach with stunning ocean views from the balcony. The staff were courteous and welcoming, always ready to help with a smile. Check-in was smooth, and the lobby had a relaxing, upscale vibe.  The room was clean and well-maintained, though slightly smaller than expected. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job daily. I especially appreciated the complimentary breakfast, which offered a good variety of hot and cold items, including fresh fruit and pastries.  However, the Wi-Fi connection was spotty, which was frustrating when trying to plan our daily outings. Also, the pool area, while attractive, got quite crowded in the afternoons, making it less relaxing than hoped."

The staff are lovely. Rooms are clean and the cleaners come everyday with fresh towels and bedding smells lovely and they work so hard. All in all beautiful hotel we hope to return soon. Thank you for making our holiday lovely from us all."

I played darts , French boules and did the Pilates and water aerobics my husband joined in with the archery . I cannot single out any particular animation member they all did a great job morning through till midnight .  The rooms were nice and big with a bath and shower within bath . The hotel exterior was being painted and carpets in hallways being replaced whilst we stayed disruption was minimal . The food was  excellent always something new to try ( did mention to staff the labels needed to be better as fish described as fish not which type of fish - we ate a lovely one but have no idea what it’s called . They said they would be making labels better )  the location of this hotel to port area 7 minutes walk and beach at hotel soft sand with plenty of sunbeds . I would definitely recommend this hotel and shall return . And forgot to mention bar staff they were excellent too ,lovely friendly and waiter service to sunbeds perfect"

Everyone in hotel from reception to restaurant to waiters at pool are amazing friendly people.  Food in restaurant was brilliant with great variety every day Lovely beach and pool(Olympic size.) Animation team work so hard and put on really good shows.  Big shout out to Montasar and Majed pool waiters for looking after us all week. Also thanks to Rami and Najah in reception.  I would highly recommend this hotel   Only negative would be poor WiFi. But you can buy 30gb Tunisian sim card nearby for £12  which works brilliant."

The hotel is very dirty and poorly maintained. There are stains everywhere, whether on the curtains or the carpet, which seems to have never been cleaned. The lack of maintenance is obvious.  In addition, there are no electrical outlets in the rooms, except the one that powers the fridge and TV, making it impossible to charge our phones. The bed was broken and despite our call at 2pm to change it, no one came until 6pm. The key to the room was working very hard and now it does not turn at all, leaving the door stuck.  We're not the only ones complaining. At the reception, every newcomer seemed to have a problem: air conditioning not working, elevators broken down, etc."

We arrived at this hotel only to discover it was a \"non alcohol\" Hotel. Which in the adverts for the hotel it stated it has 3 bars with a picture of a champagne glass beside it. My wife was constantly verbally abused by the guests due to not covering up. As for the dining buffet the guests were greedy and wasteful. They would totally fill their tables with food then leave about 65% of it, leaving the place in a mess. The poor waiting staff could not cope with the clearing up.     The hotel was poorly maintained virtually every light  wasn't working and only 1 out of 5 elevators worked. As for stating the hotel is in Monistir, It was in Skanes a total dump of a town about 20mins from monistir.       We were relocated to this hotel by love Holidays due our previous hotel not being available at the last minute, We wish now we had cancelled!!       We moved hotels paying with our own money after hiding in our room for 3 days due to the tension caused by the guests. Love Holidays were no help.      Avoid...."

Problems encountered during our stay include:  1. **Cleanliness of the room**: The room was dusty and missing sheets, which is totally unacceptable for an establishment of your standing. 2. **Equipment**: Several electrical outlets in the room were non-functional, which significantly hindered our comfort. 3. **Meal quality**: The cutlery was often dirty and the quality of meals was very poor, far from expectations for a hotel in this category.  These inconveniences have greatly impacted our experience and leave us very dissatisfied.  To flee"

        "review_text": "I stayed at Abou Sofiane Hotel & Aquapark with my partner from October 12th, 2024, and it was easily one of the worst hotel experiences we’ve ever had — especially heartbreaking since we booked this specific hotel to accommodate my partner’s chronic back condition (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), and it advertised wellness facilities that were completely non-existent.  1. FALSE ADVERTISING  The hotel’s website claims to have a spa, sauna, massage services, gym, games room, and various sports facilities. None of these were available. When we asked staff, they told us to go across the road to another hotel (Hotel Riviera) and ask them to let us use their facilities — which we weren’t allowed to do. The Friguia Zoo, listed as being 1km away, was actually 47.5km away — farther than the airport.  2. FILTHY ROOMS \t•\tWe were given burnt towels one day. \t•\tThe bathroom was mouldy, and the shower was poorly designed, leaving us to manually drain it ourselves or stand in a pool of water. \t•\tOne of our walls had a hole where a light switch should’ve been. \t•\tWe were placed in a joint room separated by a door from total strangers. We could hear everything next door — including showers and conversations — and one night the woman next door banged repeatedly on the door and then verbally abused us in a foreign language for simply watching a movie. \t•\tThe hotel reeks of cigarette smoke even though it’s advertised as a non-smoking property. Staff and concierge were smoking indoors.  3. UNHELPFUL AND UNETHICAL STAFF \t•\tNo iron available, and the hotel only offered to iron our clothes via laundry service with a 24-hour delay. \t•\tWe were withheld the TV remote unless we paid a city tax in cash the night we arrived, even though this cash-only requirement wasn’t listed prior to check-in. \t•\tWe were not even given a receipt when we paid. \t•\tThere was no cash machine on-site, forcing us to literally beg security from another hotel to let us inside just to withdraw money.  4. FOOD MADE US SICK \t•\tThere was only one restaurant open (Le Doyen) despite them listing two. The food was repetitive, bland, and left us with stomach aches and bowel issues.  5. ZERO CARE FOR GUESTS WITH DISABILITIES  We selected this hotel specifically because it claimed to offer massage, spa, and sauna services — essential for my partner’s chronic pain condition. Not one of those was available. This is not just disappointing; it’s misleading and unethical.  In summary: this hotel is a complete scam. The facilities listed on every website are outdated or outright false, the rooms are unhygienic, and the staff are disinterested at best, shady at worst. If you value your money, your health, or your peace of mind, book literally anywhere else."

Locked out of hotel room until under duress I had to pay  Asked to speak to manager every day and was always being told come back tomorrow . Manager was never in. ? Food absolutely disgusting and covered in flys  Once you found food that was edible you then had to find some plates or dishes that were not dirty to eat from  And if you want a drink , you can always use the plastic cups that have fag burns in the bottom of them  There is no food for children to enjoy and if they are hungry and u decide to go to the shop in reception you can always enjoy out of date crisps as a quick snack !  You can always relax by the pool Or in lobby where u constantly have some chubby little waiter constantly saying you look after me I’ll look after you lady , outside hotel the taxi drivers pee up the walls so it constantly stinks if urine ! Nothing is lite up at night making it a death trap For children as there is a path that leads right to pool from bar so if a child was to run off they would land in pool and no one would ever no  Pool Shuts every day at 6  This hotel is just awful I’m so disapointed that I worked hard to pay for a holiday that was awful  When booking this holiday the pictures looked stunning but don’t get hopes up as I think the pictures may be a few years old  I need a holiday to get over this holiday   Tbh you have to be drunk to stay in this awful depressing place"

The room so old equips not like the pictures, and there is no personal air conditioning the air conditioning was on until 10pm, the heat pq in the room, the water is occupied before midnight, once the electricity was interrupted, long customer service and not well. I mean, I don't recommend it because you're gonna regret it."

        "review_text": "Flights - TUI delayed us by 3 hours without any explanation to why, so we arrived much later than expected (and hungry).  Hotel room - wrong room given (paid for superior sea view), we were facing the carpark on our first night. The room had lots of ants (in the bed as well), the toilet was cracked and stained and the floors and walls felt/looked dirty.  We had to wait until 12 to change our room the next day, so we tried the breakfast whilst waiting. The corridors were very dark and dirty, not touched with a hoover in months.   Once our room was swapped, the sea view was very restricted (covered by trees and buildings). The room was cleaner though and the cleaning lady was very pleasant - deserving of tips for working so hard.   Food - very disappointing for an all inclusive holiday. The only edible thing in the morning was the pastries, the rest was unlabelled and greasy with guests often trying it before scooping it out (with the same spoon, appalling hygiene).  The lunch and dinners were extremely lackluster for British holiday goers, the trays were lukewarm with meat attached to huge lumps of fat and grease. Being 6 weeks pregnant, I physically couldn't eat any of the food, especially as there were no labels (maybe 1 to every 4 dishes) to explain what the dish was. The coffee machine was vile and the fresh juice was always warm.   The drinks served were usually flat, coke was often decanted from taps into a bottle before being poured into glasses, making them all flat on arrival. Better to buy your own drinks and keep them in the room fridge.  If it wasn't for the local shops selling Yoghurt drinks/sorbets I would've starved this entire trip. Thankfully there are restraunts around port el kantoui so if you're willing to spend extra eating out every night, you're better off.   Beware of the taxi drivers outside the hotel, they massivley overcharged us (white tourists!). A taxi TO Hard Rock cafe cost us 15 dinar, whereas a taxi back cost 2 dinar (how?!).   The hotel lobby is the ONLY place you'll get your free wifi, the rooms have none at all. Take an E sim.   The beach was the only thing I was happy with during the stay, it was clean and the water was lovely to swim in. The bar staff were very helpful as well and would often bring fresh drinks as you stood up.   Beware of the sales guys on the beach, we were nearly conned out of 70 dinar for some pictures and fruit (that we didn't ask for, it was forced into our hands). If I didn't have my partner I would've been wiped of spends very quickly as I'm too socially anxious to haggle, they can see this.   We were meant to stay a full week here but I panicked from the lack of food and bad air con to come home by day 5 - costing another £255 (£100 in phone payments, £120 for flights, £35 for taxi)  The staff were generally very polite and helpful, but it did take them 3 times for them to take our booking seriously. They had taken photos of my phone booking on the first night and I had emailed it to them (reservation number and details), and subsequently knocked on our door to come to reception for us to do this all over again another 2 times.   The bar staff are very much tip encouraged for good service, not understanding the currency we gave a staff member a tip one night to be met with a disgruntled look. Made me regret tipping in the first place.   I would not come back to this hotel, mainly because its been miss sold as a 4 star when it rightly should be a 1 or 2 star at best. Definitley wouldn't go all inclusive again as the food and drinks were highly dissapointing.   The staff do their best in a bad situation, so when service has a smile it is appreciated. Communication is often 'come back tomorrow for help'.   The streets outside the hotel smelt of pure rodents/faeces/urine, which is was sick from on our first day there.   Tunisia is a beautiful place, just unfortunately this hotel is NOT what the websites (loveholidays, im looking at you) advertise.   Pay a LOT more in another hotel if you're looking for a better experience - and THOUGHOURLY read the reviews, the 1* were accurate for what we experienced here."

        "review_text": "The room was good, the housekeeping ladies were lovely, the waiters at the pool bar were great mostly, and all of the staff were mostly friendly. The food was very hit or miss and I experienced an upset stomach for 7 of the 9 days we were there, but unable to pinpoint the cause, although the water from the coffee machine tasted of mould at our final breakfast. We were not able to have a kettle in our room, the receptionist seemed to think it was a funny request, but it may have saved my bad experience. Our sea view room had a very limited sea view and was very close to the very loud entertainment area, but thankfully the music stopped at 11pm. We had to wait 4 hours for our room on arrival, and although we were told we could get an early breakfast on our last morning, because we had an early flight, this was not the case, if fact they lost the keys to the restaurant and so it opened late, giving us 15 minutes before our transfer arrived. The indoor pool that is advertised was empty so could not be used, the outdoor pool are clean and well maintained though. There is no information given about facilities or activities, which would have been helpful. The first holiday I have ever had that I wasn’t sorry to leave!"

The infrastructures are neat, surrounded by green spaces that make the setting soothing and pleasant. The room, spacious and functional, met our expectations.  The hotel seems ideal for summer: outdoor pools, children’s playground, private beach and bungalows. Breakfast was varied and quality, served by a smiling and attentive staff – a real plus. The SPA centre is also worth a visit for a relaxing break.    2x points a little disappointing for such a beautiful establishment, however:   - Reception & departure at reception cold & very expeditious,  - The method of information on checkout times (a paper slipped under the door!!!!) Very surprising & really useless!! Especially in low season!   Overall, the experience remains positive. This property is a good option @ South Hammamet."

What a nice surprise upon arrival the hotel is beautiful the rooms are perfect and cleaned every day. The bedding is excellent! The restaurant remains a buffet like all buffets some dishes often come back mostly at the starters but all the dishes were very good and varied every day. The staff is so nice and helpful whether at reception, bar or restaurant. The animation team is also very nice! The hotel is very clean wooded and lots of greenery. I also recommend Samir in the hotel that offers excursions (the catamaran is top! ). Massage services are excellent and very inexpensive for a one hour service. In short a perfect holiday and I can already announce that next year we will return to this hotel with our eyes closed.  Thank you for everything and see you soon!"

We said yes, and to our surprise, they brought us some delicious food. It was the first time we experienced such hospitality – where a hotel served their guests a meal after check-in!  When we entered our room, our first impression wasn’t great. We thought the room looked old and outdated, but we were tired and went to sleep. The next morning, I spoke to the reception and mentioned that the room felt too old. That’s when I realized it wasn’t old – it was vintage! The entire hotel is designed in a classic, vintage style that gives it so much character.  As we explored the hotel more, we were impressed by everything it offered. The food was simply wonderful and absolutely delicious. The staff were amazing – their hospitality was beyond what we could have imagined.  The spa experience was also fantastic. There’s a gentleman there with three lovely ladies – Wahida, Khadija, and Samar– who give the most amazing massages. Their care and professionalism made the spa visit truly special.  The animation was great and every night they laughed us. All guys in the animation were all good specially Maro, Sam and Dali.   can’t call this just a 5-star hotel – I’d say it’s a 7-star or even 9-star experience! I’ve traveled to many countries for holidays, but from now on, my number one destination is Tunis, and specifically, Hammamet Garden Hotel.  This hotel is exceptional, and I can’t wait to return again and again. Thank you for such an unforgettable stay!"

Thank you to all the staff of the Hammamet Garden hotel for their kindness, availability and smile. Special mentions to the little masseuse, to little Mohamed from the bar, and to Sonia from the reception. But they are all great (spa, kitchen, service, cleaning and maintenance, entertainment...). Thank you, it's people like them who want to come back. The art of hospitality."

No room in the restaurant, sportsmen passing us in front of the buffets, no drinks offer at mealtime. Few choices at buffet level, almost non-existent desserts. Very noisy hotel due to all these young sportsmen gathered, who are the kings of oil and we may have complained about the noise (especially at night), we quickly realized that at the hotel it was the last of their problem. No or little animation due to the presence of handball players.  Beach not according to what was advertised. Disappointed with our week, not restful. Beautiful outdoor pool. Friendly staff"

Felt hot so the staff got the fan from the security guard to keep our children that little cooler.   Fussy in the restaurant the chefs made a special pizza to my request.   NOW the entertainment team - WOW! We have travelled to many inclusive 5star hotels and never had the dedication that this team provide day in day out even missing a day off to come and wish my wife happy birthday.   If your looking for decor then it’s not for you if your looking for a hotel that needs some support and want some real fun to let your hair down with games, care and real genuine attention then give this place a shot and ignore the bad reviews.

        "review_text": "Well as you can see by the title 3 visits in one year,the hotel must do some things right. Not a perfect score though but let's leave the negative stuff to the end. So No 1 for me is the complete Value For Money you get from this 24 Hour All Inclusive. The Friendliness of the staff whether it is bar waiters,food waiters,animation team,cleaners,gardeners and reception. Special mention to Ben \" my brother's,kept me supplied with various drinks during the day,water, Mint tea,B52 and Vodka Sprite. The rooms are a bit dated but very clean and maid very good. Entertainment team led by my friend Rio are a new team but very good.Only slight criticism is in the last year nothing at all new.Same shows but good  nonetheless. So now we come to the main negative the Food. Firstly I will say that you will never starve at this hotel but sometimes the choice and quality of food let's them down. Breakfast was ok with Omelette and fried eggs and some pastries.Toaster is a waste of time. Lunch at Wok with Sammi with Pizza,Noodles,fish was pretty good.But in the beach restaurant pretty poor quality and a lot of things cold. During the day from Noon to 6pm beside the Pool there is a pink burger van,and to be fair their burgers and panini's were pretty good. Now for most people after day on the beach theirmain meal of the day is dinner.But this has been the main bone of contention formost people.Choice and quality are the 2 main words that come to mind.As I explained to a manager it is not more British style food I wanted but more good Tunisian food like Brik.Yes they went and made me one and it was on menu most nights after that.Ihot treated very well last few nights and they even asked me night before what I wanted next day.Iy will be interesting if they continue to improve in this aspect. But 10 out of 10 for listening and improving last few days of my hols. So to sum up if you want Value for Money,friendly staff,great entertainment and plenty food and drink come here. If you are a huge \" Foodie\" not the place for you. I will be back in November keep the food improvement coming along😎❤️"

        "review_text": "I stayed at Les Orangers Beach Hotel in Hammamet, Tunisia from May 19 to 24 with my grandmother, and unfortunately, the experience did not live up to our expectations at all.  First of all, the food was extremely repetitive. After two days, it felt like we were eating exactly the same thing, without any strain. In addition, I noticed very unequal treatment by the restaurant staff: if you are not English, German or “typically French”, you are almost completely ignored. No smile, no look, a real feeling of marginalization.  I was also very shocked to see that bottles of wine were automatically placed on all tables, as if it were a norm that everyone should drink alcohol, without taking into account customers who do not consume alcohol for religious reasons.  The reception on arrival went well, but at the time of departure, it was a different story: the receptionist slept on a sofa (it was 2am for a departure at 2:40am for the airport) impossible to return the card or make the formalities of departure. This is a huge lack of professionalism.  Regarding the room: this is one of the worst points of the stay. First, it is never stated that the central air conditioning does not work until June 1. The result: unbearable heat throughout the building. I had to insist on being given a room with individual air conditioning. Second, there is no soundproofing. The walls are so thin that you can hear everything that happens in the neighbors. We were awakened several times in the middle of the night by din, screaming, music, and one night in particular was totally unacceptable we were awakened by very explicit intimate noises... inadmissible in a hotel supposed to be family-friendly. Indeed, the hotel calls itself family-run, but nothing is put in place to guarantee a minimum of privacy and tranquility.  The pool is also very small. As soon as there are a few people, it becomes difficult to swim comfortably.  As for Wi-Fi, it’s simply a lie. There is only at the reception. No connection in the rooms, not to the restaurant, not to the pool, not to the beach. For a hotel that calls itself 4 stars, this is unacceptable.  Fortunately, there were some positives: the beach is really nice and the security guards are very professional and welcoming. The cleaning in the rooms is perfectly done, the maids are very serious and do an excellent job. The balconies are also nice to enjoy a little outside.  But in all honesty, this is not enough to compensate for all the shortcomings. This hotel is definitely not worth its 4 stars. To me, it's worth two, not more. I would not recommend this property, especially if you are traveling with family or seniors."

Whilst we ate in the restaurants at the beginning, we ended up having all melas on the veranda overlooking the beach.  For breakfast we were given a list to choose from, but for other meals just ask and they will try to help. We chose  a BBQ one night which was very nice.  Mini bar fridge was full on arrival with branded drinks, came around often to see if we wanted anything more. Asked for some water, got 12 bottles, asked for a g and t, got a litre bottle of gin. Bottle of Schweppes tonic, a plate of sliced lemons and a bucket if ice.  Wi-Fi also good in the room, even streamed a movie on the iPad, no buffering. Overall a very relaxing holiday and great to reset."

The animation team here made my holiday, along with the bar staff and waiter they really do deserve a pay rise they have such long days and are so hard working! Always smiling and enthusiastic! My 6 month old had the best time due to the animation team.  The hotel is clean and constantly being cleaned. Everyone is friendly. I probs wouldn’t come back due to food and not anything really to do near by but we made the most of it!  Also the staff here are on around £5 a day in English money Wich is so sad because they are so hard working!"

        "review_text": "Upon arrival at the hotel our transfer was around 2- 2.5 hours from the airport, we had a direct transfer without any stops. As we arrived late, there were no facilities open apart from duty free in the airport at night to buy snacks / drinks so make sure you have some if you need it prior to leaving your departure airport or the airplane onboard snacks.   At arrival they did however save us some food and plated up a salad, some chicken, rice and potatoes which was a nice touch and gave us a large bottle of water. This was around 11pm.  Tunisia is a closed currency so if you need some and haven’t organised this at the airport, there is a cash point approximately 10 mins walk from the hotel.   At the hotel our check in process was easy and we were given a selection of rooms to chose from. We chose the sea view which was basic, but definitely fine for our needs.   Please note, this hotel probably was a 5* back in the day, but realistically it’s more like 3*.   We had 2 single beds, separate toilet and bathroom with a balcony. The tv had Channels but were mainly in French. WiFi throughout the hotel is pretty good though so you can use your phone to stream to the tvs etc if you want to. The room was carpeted throughout and many have criticised this - we personally didn’t see this as an issue as it was cleaned daily and the maids were in the room daily to clean/ change towels etc.  The food is relatively basic and repetitive. We came at the start of season so it’s probably unfair to give a full true reflection but we managed to find something to eat everyday without failure,  although found breakfast the most limited. There is however cereal, omelettes, eggs and crepes which we tended to eat repetitively. Lunches varied generally with the options being fish or beef with rice or potatoes and similarly with the evening meal with sometimes offering turkey or chicken. At breakfast you can pay 4 dinar for fresh orange - worth it! Please note every day there is Pizza freshly made so at the very least you’ll definitely find something to eat.   The bar soft drinks are Fanta/ coke / lemonade, then there is strawberry juice, lemon and orange (these are like dilute but extremely strong). There is also a machine which you can find with breakfast offering pineapple juice, apple, orange, tropical juice etc. again we found we had to dilute with a little water. At the bar you can ask for water and they give you a big bottle of 1.5l which is handy so don’t buy this from the shop on site!   As for alcoholic drinks there are local spirits, beer, wine and cocktails. The cocktails vary depending on who makes them but I would say the pina colada was probably the closest to what it should taste like.   Please note it is quite pushy for sales of quads/ camels or The spa treatments, equally if you go out into the town of Mahdia make sure you hide your wristband! They use the local “oh I’m a chef at your hotel” technique to lure you into their shops to buy souvenirs. It is extremely difficult to avoid so be aware of this in advance!   The overall hotel facilities are great. Yes in need of decoration and a slight upgrade in terms of modernisation but if you take it at face value and you’re not a Karen you’ll have a fantastic time here. It is a lovely hotel with a fantastic team of people running it - customer service is excellent from all staff.  Finally The entertainment team / animation team. These people work tirelessly day in day out for extremely little money! They are fantastic at what they do and we’ve had a great holiday as a result. They get you involved in the dances, make you feel like a person and not just a number at the hotel and I can honestly say they’re great given their limited resources.   Overall I’d say this holiday for get away all inclusive has been fantastic for us and we definitely would return. Given it was start of season, its hard to give a true reflection of everything but I would say from what we have experienced as long as you don’t have too many high expectations you’ll have a great holiday here.  If you go looking for issues you’ll definitely find them, but if you’re looking for the sun, a nice environment and people who are genuinely interested in making your holiday then I would definitely recommend this hotel."

        "review_text": "Avoid, avoid, avoid at all costs. This hotel is advertised as a 5 star, I would give 2 stars if it is lucky! Also stated it is 30 minutes from the airport, well it is at least 4 hours. Have stayed around the world in several 4/5 star all inclusive hotels and some are not so good as others, accepted. But this place… We are on holidays, we work hard all the year round and enjoy good wine and food. Drinks are served in plastic glasses, they are warm and not nice. So if you get the last glass of wine in the bottle around 22:00, they say “it’s gone “ and won’t open any more!! We did pay for all inclusive, but it is just not delivered. In the bathroom, there are holders for toothbrush cups etc, but no cups!! Food is average, well below average. The a la carte restaurant (there is only one, but advertised at three) is open three nights a week and the lovely restaurant manager Mr Mourani or something made sure we were booked in every time. Also this hotel is advertised as “ in the heart of the new tourist area”. Well, outside and for the walkable distance, is just wasteland and roaming dogs and a few restaurants. Please note, if you like to walk and stop at a bar for a beer, they do not serve any alcohol whatsoever outside the hotel. Our air conditioning stopped working first day and we reported it at reception and he told us “all stops in October “. Blatant lie as our room cleaner fixed it. Also it was remarked by a group of young Tunisian men in one of the cafes, that I was not wearing a hijab.  Top tip, bribe the bar staff, give them £10 at the start of your holiday and you will get real glasses and slightly better drinks.  Even better tip, DONT GO!!!"

Wild dogs on the beach and staff that are not interested as season winds down. All inclusive do not bother as the Hotel will not provide it Evan though you pay for it. The hygiene of this Hotel is poor with guests getting sick, food standards and selection was the worst we have ever experienced in all our travels uneditable possibly the only all inclusive we have lost weight. The sunbed mattress were sticky and done the dinner mats in the restaurant unclean and The Entertainment more enthusiasm in a primary school play. The Hotel is 1hour and 40 minutes from airport in a bus that nearly cost us our lives with a dangerous driver on his phone all the time. I can not stress enough do not use this Hotel and believe me this is brief total waste of money.😡"

        "review_text": "In other hotels just don't swerve into this one! The reception on arrival totally overwhelmed, not even a page helps you bring the suitcases to the room. In the main restaurant there is no eye-catching, totally chaotic the table clearing/uncovering, food was not written to - ALLERGERS have the total look. The manager does not take care of the hotel areas at all, neither does they control them. After contact, the guest gets the impression that the guest is annoying!  The manager is also not receptive to small suggestions for improvement. Wi-Fi only in lobby area. The dishes are broken off - you can get injured here- is nevertheless offered to the guest every day again.  Even with a hotel that has become old, you can maintain the standard with daily checks, which has not been the case here for years.  It was only during an announced visit from the management level that the guests were able to experience the hustle and bustle of the day before. Since everything was then acutely cleaned on high polish, trimmed, swept, cleaned, covered, fixed - I would suggest to the hotel management times incognito check in there 2 days, then you can see it directly that the pretended quality is just sham! My rating: Don't go to this hotel, because you can spend your saved holiday money better elsewhere where quality is right!"

        "review_text": "We stayed here for 10 nights October 2024, the hotel is absolutely beautiful! Rooms are big with loads of storage and a beautiful balcony view!! The hotel has 2 pools & a kids pool, a spa, 2 bars and loads of activities included with the all inclusive. Such as football, volleyball, beach volleyball, darts, ping pong, pool, archery. People work on the beach directly outside for jet skis, boat trips and the hotel can organise excursions, we did quad biking and camel riding. The hotel is about 15 minute drive from Madhia city which is an absolutely gorgeous place. We also ate out 3/4 times and all nearby restaurants are amazing. The food in and out of the hotel was all beautiful, there’s loads of option and is served beautifully. The drinks menu in the hotel is slightly limited however they have most alcoholic drinks/ soft drinks. I definitely recommend asking the hotels photographer (they have 2) to take pictures and print them, we did and ours are beautiful. There isn’t an ATM at the hotel but one about 15 mins walk, however you can change currency in the hotel. There’s also 2 shops which have literally everything you could need on holiday! We had a shuttle transfer and it took about 31/2 hours so I do recommend getting a private transfer to save time. Other than the long transfer i cant say anything bad about this hotel, it’s absolutely beautiful with lovely people, good food and in a good location in Madhia. Will definitely be back next year!!"

The hotel was spotless the staff were friendly and helpful.

        "review_text": "The room was old, spoiled, with stained carpeting where you were afraid to walk barefoot on it (foot fungus). AC condensation dripped on carpet. There was initially no safe, which was then brought in afterwards and simply placed on the shelf of the wardrobe, brief briefing, that was it.  The food for breakfast & dinner was below average. Unlovingly presented and manufactured. Scoop dishes such as ragouts or goulash with bones on the meat, food, vegetables and side dishes were pushed cold from the kitchen (not hygienic with HACCP, food must be heated to at least 65°C, also in Tunisia) and only warmed in the edition !!!!. Every morning we had the same white bread, we had different in Tunisia. There wasn't even toast. For an omelette you had to wait in line for 20 minutes. The worst part was the placemats, disgusting. Absolutely unhygienic, dirty, because in the plastic net still the remains of the predecessor. From Friday to Sunday, the hotel was packed with locals, where we don't mind in principle, but the eating habits just made us shake our heads and feel uncomfortable. The food selection and preparation was also underground on those days. Hotel has a top location, beach, loungers and umbrella good. Pool is in need of renovation. Annimation not with passion. All in all a total bust, except top location and beach"

When we called the front desk, they checked twice looking in the room, instead of just apologizing. Not at all professional.  Few choices for dinner and breakfast. The spa pool was not clean. As for the view, it was very disappointing because of the outdoor pool, completely empty, when the weather was nice and we could have enjoyed it.  How can a 5-star hotel accommodate its guests with an empty pool, especially when it’s supposed to be the highlight of the property? The whole experiment was ruined.  Frankly, either you are a real 5-star hotel and you rise to the occasion, or you assume a 4- or 3-star rating. I don’t know who awards the stars in Tunisia, but clearly it’s not justified here.  We left very disappointed. One thing is certain: we will not come back."

In the early morning, we're ground and broken.  Another point: in the thermal pool, there is no ramp to descend into the basin. Since the water is cloudy because of mineral salts, we descend to the judge on rather slippery steps, which is not at all ideal. In the end, despite the beauty of the site and the kindness of the staff, a second stay is not at all certain."

When we arrive no bottle of water in the room. At the restaurant for dinner, no olive oil and a rude waiter shouting in front of everyone: \"I ALREADY TOLD HIM THERE WAS NO OLIVE OIL!\" (the butler did what was necessary, sent him away and finally brought olive oil...

The hotel also offers a 2h boat tour to get to the hot springs which we loved, the scenery is really beautiful and the sailors very friendly! I highly recommend this hotel for a perfect stay in Tunisia! Absolutely nothing wrong, everything was there and our expectations were more than met! Many thanks to all the staff and especially Hatem for his extreme kindness and availability! We hope to return very soon!"

        "review_text": "1st trip Djerba and probably the last.An island infested with plastic waste of all kinds.Regarding the hotel reception hall top we think that the rest will be the same and there total disappointment as soon as access to our room long corridors with windows, doors that date from another time and I do not even talk to you about filthy and stained carpets. We had 1 room garden view finally if we can say a vacant lot with excavator and piles of rubble.The restaurant at breakfast if you like stale bread, at lunch and dinner dishes that look like nothing without tastes and repetitive no worries and yet we are not difficult. The beach: not enough deckchairs and dirty. Swimming pool: logically no deckchair reservation but in the morning towels already installed so after 3 days without place you do the same thing. Bar: terrace too small for the number of people in the hotel. Hyper-sweet, untasteful, infectious cocktails. We didn't understand everything about this hotel, why a brand new padel court that must cost a small fortune that will serve very little instead of renovating the interiors and carpets???management is not making the right decisions and risks losing many customers if nothing is done to stay 4*  After all these criticisms, we salute the good humor, smiles and courage of all the staff: employees, cleaning lady, bartender, waiters at the bar and restaurant, receptionists, photographer (Fethi,Houssem,Karim,lorenzo...) Without them we would certainly have changed hotels.  I still have not understood the positive reviews and we are not on our 1st trip."

        "review_text": "I arrived at hotel 8.45pm and was greeted by a lovely man at reception called Havib. Was told that I could go straight to the restaurant to eat.  At the restaurant there was about 20 empty tables, the others were being used. One waiter seen me trying to find a table to use. I asked if I could use a table that wasn’t set up and he said ok. After collecting my food I came back to the same table was still not ready. So I sat and waited, and waited and ended up using my hands to eat! Waiter finally came over with cutlery. I was asked if I wanted a drink and I asked for cola zero..was abruptly told to go to the machine and get it…went to the drinks dispenser and there was no cola zero on tap.  I stayed in room 1439, room was dated, curtains were hanging down as part was detached from the rail. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Food in the hotel was good, I particularly liked the Tunisian food.  As a regular visitor to Tunisia and as an ex holiday rep working and living in Tunisia for 3 years I was surprised that the animation team never even bothered to say a simple “hi” to me in the week that I was there. Maybe if I was a single woman then I might have been worthy of some acknowledgment. Having said that, the animation team seemed to work hard  Restaurant staff weren’t particularly friendly towards me but one Maitre d’ was kind an acknowledged my birthday and even came to find me when I left. They had a cake for me which I thought was very kind.  Reception totally ignored me once when I went to enquire about a transfer. Went back later and Habib sorted it. Habib was friendly and professional. If I had a business I’d employ him.  Pool area was lovely and so was the beach.  It was my first time in Djerba. Personally, I prefer Sousse and Port El Kantaoui"

        "review_text": "Let's start with the positive: The animation team was very friendly and the setting is great.  Small souvenir shop near the hotel with very attractive prices! As for the negative:  It was not until a seminary arrived that we had a buffet worthy of the name. No choice at the all-you-can-eat buffet, no indication of the products offered, no fish, no local pastries, 2 local dishes that fight in a duel. No information on arrival regarding access to infrastructure (all inclusive/half board/free activities or not). We learned from being turned away at an activity/evening that it was only for members of the “Coralia Club” (we still don’t know what it is). Difference in treatment between all inclusive and half boarders and members of the Coralia Club. Restaurant and bar staff not at all pleasant (especially superiors). Difficult management of meals when there are people, tense flow at the level of dishes and service in the room (no glass, no water...).  The music is too loud by the pool and let’s not talk about the evening, we hear it in the rooms as if we were at the party.  Concerning the bedding much too hard (mattress / pillow). The broken shower curtain bar, it holds thanks to the sdb mirror. No air conditioning in the room just ventilation... No poolside bar or even a snack if a small dip is made in the afternoon (winter period apparently).  Regarding their wellness area, for the installation of polish, it is done as follows: we paint the nail as well as the entire finger then remove the surplus with a piece of wood. As for the massage, it was just a layer of oil that I was brushed with for 1 hour.  Anyway, once not twice."

        "review_text": "We stayed in this establishment for a week, after the 3rd day we had to change rooms because too much problem in the 1st (778). The rooms are very poorly insulated, you can hear all the noises of the rooms next door especially the resonance of the hallway and the doors slammed. The infrastructure is old and poorly maintained. Unheated swimming pool, broken deckchairs, rusty table outside. Then for the unlimited buffet it's always the same, after a while it's tiring so at our own expense we left the establishment to eat in the restaurants that are next door (Gaia and the restaurant at the port of aghir). For the activities offered by the people of the central corridor it is a little expensive for what it is but the accompaniments are adorable. If you want to change your currency at the hotel, they only take cash and not with the CB. We had to find a vending machine because they told us to do it at the airport when we arrived but we arrived at 21:30, so everything was closed. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. The spa is suitable but poorly maintained. In fact the hotel is not a 4* but rather a 2* with sea views. Do not rely on photos especially the rooms because you will not have all the services indicated on the photos. This hotel has a big potential but really misused. We will not return to this property.

He showed professionalism from beginning to end and accompanied us throughout the stay. All the excursions were done with him and everything went very well. Thanks to him we had very nice taxis and who knew the history of the island well. I wanted to thank him for his kindness since even when we had problems (with our rental car) he was there to help us and follow us he was really our protector during this trip.

The rooms are well maintained (and I could notice improvement being done) The best beach access (a highlight) and beautiful gardens with lots of birds. The service from all the staff was outstanding, specially from the fabulous manager (Nouel), she was awesome and always there to help and making sure all guests were having the best time… she knows how customer service works. kudos for her!   Love the ambience and breakfast was also enjoyable… the bread they make right in front of you was a highlight and delicious!   The pool area was tranquil and beautiful too (see video attached). I highly recommend this hotel for families, couples, friends or solo travelers, no regrets!!!"

        "review_title": "The worst people and the worst hotel in Tunisia",
        "review_text": "This hotel single-handedly ruined all the wonderful impressions I had accumulated of Tunisia and its people in just one day. The attitude of the reception staff, particularly the female receptionist, was appallingly rude, verging explicitly on racism. These were by far the worst hotel staff I have ever encountered, even surpassing the abysmal condition of the hotel’s facilities. My experience was so dreadful that it made all the positive reviews for this place seem entirely fictional.  Room: Wi-Fi does not work in the rooms; it barely functions even in the hotel lobby. The room reeks of cigarette smoke. In the bathroom, the bathtub drainage is clogged, and when the shower is turned on, water sprays uncontrollably in every direction, making proper showering impossible. The sink is equally clogged. Even if one somehow manages to tolerate all these defects, the worst part remains the staff.  Worst Staff—Shame on Tunisia: Throughout my travels in Tunisia, I encountered wonderfully hospitable and kind people who left lasting positive impressions. They treated foreigners with fairness, often returning mistakenly overpaid money without hesitation. However, at this hotel, staff claimed they had no change and promised to return it later. When I later asked for my change, they feigned ignorance, audaciously demanding that I provide proof that the change had not been returned. As retaliation for insisting on my rightful money, they refused to arrange taxi services. Located remotely, every time I requested a taxi, the staff deliberately lied about calling one, leaving me stranded. Consequently, I had to walk nearly 2 kilometers under the scorching sun to reach a main road where I could hail a taxi myself, painfully watching taxis entering other hotels effortlessly.  Repeatedly, I wasted 30 minutes to an hour waiting futilely at the hotel for taxis, eventually forced to endure the blistering walk. The staff proved themselves incompetent, discriminatory, hostile, and disgraceful. After traveling throughout Tunisia for an entire month, the worst region was undeniably Djerba, the worst accommodation was this hotel, and the worst Tunisians were undoubtedly these hotel employees. My experience at this hotel was even more traumatic than being robbed of my camera by a thief in Monastir. Although I wholeheartedly recommend traveling to Tunisia, I vehemently discourage visiting Djerba, solely due to this hotel and its staff. The employees here, supposedly professionals in the hospitality industry, bring shame upon the entire nation. From room quality to food and staff attitudes—absolutely nothing was acceptable. The only positive interaction was with a young man working as a safeguard by the beach, who was genuinely kind and helpful.  Before booking a room, ensure you thoroughly verify the Wi-Fi, as it absolutely does not work despite their advertisements. Be aware that the actual facilities differ significantly from advertised photographs, and the bathroom issues are severely problematic. Additionally, be cautious when requesting a room change, as staff may shamelessly demand money. Amidst an otherwise fantastic journey through Tunisia, this was unquestionably the worst lodging experience, and thus I leave this review here as a warning."

        "review_text": "I was in Jerba with my family in May at another Inn. This time, I go back with my family and decide to take my girlfriend there. For the first time we are staying at Dar El Bhar.  We had booked a double room next to my sister's but this one was already taken. My girlfriend and I ended up in a room that needed some repairs and some treatment. We talked about our problems that same evening and we were taken seriously directly. The next day, we were given a new room and this one, dedicated to a family, was more spacious and comfortable. Finally, we spent 10 days at the top! Here are the little + and - that we can say about our stay.     Plus +:   +It is a small Pension with few people so very quiet but be careful, there is no entertainment service (for us it suited us very well:))  + We were not half board but we sometimes ate in the Pension restaurant. The quality of service of ALI (restaurant server). He is excellent, professional and very funny. A man with great charisma and humor. The dishes are hearty and very good. WATCH OUT for their harness, it pickles:)   +All the teams, including the reception staff, valets with the magical RACHID and the sweet SONIA and security are perfect.  +Very warm and smiling people, they work very hard but day after day they continue to have a smile and are very receptive to the questions they are asked.  + Hotel very cozy and charming. The inner courtyard really highlights the place. Birds and our friends cats bring a beautiful atmosphere to the place. Lots of cachet!  +Buffet breakfast very decent, with fresh pancakes made in front of you.  +Small shop 5 minutes walk for souvenirs, cigarettes, drinks and snacks etc.  +Swimming pool and direct access to the sea behind the Pension.  +Bar \"feet in the sand\".  +Snacks can be cooked during the day in case of small hunger by the pool. The brigs are excellent. Olives, peanuts and other small snacks can also be requested.   Less - :  -The waiters of the bar (day and evening) have difficulty understanding what is asked of them: they nod, but the order is often not right. We believe that all waiters should receive a day of classes to improve their service and make drinks (the cocktails were always made differently).   -Lack of dynamism and smile (we are aware of the small salaries and the difficulty that we Tunisians but we pay a service anyway).  -In the evening, the music is very correct by DJ Karim (special mention to his cocktails and his professionalism, he is the manager of the bar) but from 11pm, the singers of Tunisian music sing extremely loud into their microphones and this gives a certain cacophony with the music of the Pension Telemac next door.  -Fast mediocre service even when picking up our drinks at the bar because it lacks communication between them and some stay in front of the cash register without really helping their colleagues.  -Allergies must be taken much more seriously, because in Europe many people are allergic to certain foods (for example nuts) while in Africa it is not in their embarrassment to be allergic to this and they do not understand enough what is at stake.  -Swimming pool quite large and deep but lacks a little cleanliness because they do not brush every day. The tiles could be redone.  -Clean floors in general. The floors are made in the morning, but with the number of passes, sand on the feet etc, it quickly becomes dirty again.   Showers a little badly made with one wall.. all the water splashes on the ground.  Despite these few negatives, we had a pleasant stay and we will definitely return to Dar El Bhar!"

        "review_text": "The hotel is highly recommended for its facilities, spectacular breakfast and beautiful beach which is practically in the garden. What you have to make sure if you book x mail is that when they answer that your reservation is confirmed, that the signatory puts their name and charge in the hotel. It happened that we arrived and our reservation had never been entered. I had all the emails I sent and they replied confirming my reservation but did not take them into account. Finally after a very bad time and several comings and goings with Fatma (manager who arrived later) sent our friendly couple to another hotel (which was higher category and whose difference they wanted to charge!) and we were able to stay there in the only room left available.  I have to admit that the manager who was that night and another gentleman whose names I don’t remember were extremely kind to us but I can’t say the same about Fatma, who can be very good at running a hotel but not for public relations with guests (her manners and shouts leave quite a lot to be desired). A little anecdote: as a gentleman for the bad time we were given dinner that night. They give us the menus and suddenly we see coming almost running to Fatma who looks at the maitre as an indication and he practically rips the cards from our hands, to give us another very poor one that had only a menu option. We feel totally untreated and humiliated!! If this unfortunate fact had not happened I could say that the hotel deserves five stars and obviously we will return!!!"

There is a great rooftop and a guest kitchen which is helpful to have (though not well equipped or used.   It is a hostel though, so its basic. The rooms are around a coatyard so it can get noisy- my friend had a crying baby in room next door which made it hard to sleep.  Internet is patchy. And weirdly in such a coffee drinking country the breakfast (otherwise good) had instant coffee which is frustrating....I hate instant coffee!  But the real deal is that it is the only cheap hotel in the Medina, the local area is friendly and untouristy, and if you stay there you are immersed in real old Tunis which is worth a lot in my book."

Staying in the medina is terrific, both for sightseeing during the day and also for going for pleasant walks and cheap bites to eat at night). It is well inside the medina but located in a place that makes it easy to find. The staff are super nice and helpful and accommodating. My room was comfortable, the (shared) bathrooms are clean, there is hot water, and breakfast is big and good. I would definitely recommend it. Great value."

If you are in need of a Corby Trouser Press then go and stay in the French bit... and doesn’t expect it to be up to your standards.  This is a two star place but the best among all. You’ll share your shower but with few others. The place is clean, and interesting but most of all the people are friendly.  However.  Are sure you know why you are coming to Tunis. It isn’t tourist-orientated yet. I saw few other foreigners."

        "review_text": "Our group was comprised of four mature women who were there to teach at an English camp for a week. We were there in early July and the heat was what one might expect in Tunisia at that time of year: HOT!  Dar Ya was a really great experience.   Our room was on the first floor, and there was no AC. This traditional style Tunisian home had no windows to the outside so we relied heavily on the fan in our room. I had also brought a small personal fan which I'd recommend. There was another group of 10 teenagers and leaders staying there at the same time, and they had 2 rooms upstairs, one with an AC unit.   There were two showers, two sinks, and about 5 toilets which were shared with the other first floor guests.  They were cleaned each morning and everything was well-maintained.   The morning breakfast was really great and offered hard boiled eggs, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, pastries, yogurt, coffee and tea served on beautiful Tunisian pottery. The staff are so accommodating and when the gentleman who set up the daily breakfast realized we had an early flight, he made sure we had coffee and pastries.   As someone else stated, the lighting in our room was rather dim, but we made it work. Also, WiFi was available for free, but rather weak. I'd definitely stay there again. It was a great location and felt very safe."

The room was cosy and a locked closet was available. The breakfast was really good and offered a variety of options both foreign and Tunisian. The internet was slow but still functional. The staff was extremely helpful, they picked me up from the taxi since it is quite hard for cars to access and dropped me off to the closest place where I could find a taxi after I checked out. They give me a lot of advice on what is around.  Safe and nice for girls traveling alone (my case). It was also really nice to get the chance to talk to the staff about life in Tunisia especially with Hamza, thank you for everything :)"

As I checked in he got me a map of the medina and marked out good places to eat and how to get around. The owner (I think) doesn't speak English and my grade 8 French is weak to say the least, was so nice as well. When I was checking out he grabbed my big backpack and carried it 2or 3 blocks to get me a cab to the train station. The room was clean and the breakfast was amazing, I recommend getting up early at least one day to enjoy the fresh pastries while they are warm."

Bukhatine (mixture of bukha and cedratine) show with fiery bar etc... The chef bartenders also prepared us special cocktails super good: one in coffee another in chocolate and the last lemon mint banana: a delight   The team that looked after the children is also of high quality.

The food wasn’t anything phenomenal, but there was always something to choose from, so you won’t go hungry. The rooms were of a standard quality – clean, but rather small for two people.  In general, I’d say the hotel is quite average – everything is okay, nothing really stands out. BUT… what truly makes this place special and makes me want to return are the animators. Absolutely amazing people! Each of them has their own unique personality, and together they form a cheerful, well-coordinated team that makes you feel genuinely cared for.  I travel a lot around the world, especially in Africa, and I’ve never met such outstanding animators.  Special thanks to: \t•\tJIMMY, who leads yoga and will take care of you like no one else. He is definitely my favourite person. \t•\tZIZO, who has more energy than anyone I’ve ever met – there’s no chance to get bored with him around! \t•\tSMILEY, an awesome DJ who provides great music and fun – he’s both funny and charming. \t•\tMAYA, always smiling and ready to have a good conversation about anything. \t•\tKEITA, who runs great aqua aerobics during the day and keeps you laughing in the evening. \t•\tMIMO, an incredibly talented dancer and choreographer – I’m honestly surprised talent scouts haven’t discovered him yet!  Thank you all for these 10 wonderful days. I hope to see you again!"

The animators are hyper dynamic and always try to please us.  Regarding the restaurant part it was perfect. Very varied and very good food. Not necessarily just Tunisian dishes.  A huge thank you to Farid who allowed us to spend an exceptional anniversary evening that we will not soon forget. A man of great heart and care.  There will still be 2 small downsides: evening entertainment stopped way too early, probably because we were not in high season, and then the Quad exit proposed to the hotel which will have been disappointing because we will have only made road and an unnecessary stop of 15 min for je ne sais quoi. It would have been better to warn us that it was mostly a walk which would have been less frustrating for some of us who wanted a little sensations on beautiful tracks.  Mahmoud listened to us and made us beautiful proposals for our stay to be most pleasant. Thanks also to Faten who advised us well for the visits. With a heavy heart we went back on the road but full of emotions and memories."

        "review_text": "Hotel Palm Azur is the perfect place for complete relaxation, both for the lazy one, lying on a lounger by the pool or on a beautiful beach sipping delicious drinks, and for the active one, thanks to the best team of Animators. It is thanks to the Animators that you can't get bored there! Games, fun, competitions, sports. Special thanks to Jimmy! He is a walking volcano of energy, he is everywhere, always smiling and very helpful. He will calm you down during morning yoga and stretching sessions or while playing mini golf and will give you a good workout during a game of beach volleyball or aqua fitness. What the whole team of Animators does in the evening is a real bomb! They can liven up and get literally everyone dancing! Great dancers, energetic, full of passion, spontaneous. It is wonderful to watch them. Energy, energy and more energy! The food is delicious, varied and the restaurant staff is very nice and smiling. The rooms are clean, spacious and atmospheric. The area is quiet. But it is thanks to the Animators Jimmy, Maja, Zizu, Mimo, Alex, Kaito and Mimi that I will definitely come back there! They are the main ones who create this place!"

        "review_text": "We have just returned from a week in the sun at the Palm Azur, and our stay was stunning!   The hotel was clean and tidy, the food was plentiful with a good choice on most days, and the beach was just at the foot of the hotel.  A special watch out for the spa, we experienced massages by a lady who was clearly not trained, and therefore had bruises for the next two days - this is a bit we would miss out when we visit again.  The room was cleaned everyday without fail, and the service is impeccable.  The reason why we have given it 4 out of five stars is just the few things that were lacking - no chips in sight all week (which is survival food for an all inclusive), the a la carte restaurant didn’t have a menu, or take any dietary requirements into consideration or offer alternatives, a huge deposit needed for an iron, a kettle in the room but no tea making facilities, and all-inclusive hotel, but no drinks in the fridge, these small things would have made our trip exceptional.  Our highlight was absolutely the entertainment team who were excellent, every day there was heaps of activities around the pool and the evening entertainment kept us busy!   A special shout out to Zizu, Mimo and Jamie who added that extra touch of ‘special’ and kept the smiles coming all day - thank you all, you topped our holiday and we can’t wait to re-visit - mainly because of you!"

We had the pleasure of hosting the Sunset Fusion Festival at Palm Azur, and we couldn’t dream of a better venue for this event.  The setting is simply exceptional: between the sea and palm grove, everything is brought together to create an atmosphere that is both soothing and inspiring. The infrastructure is perfectly adapted to the organization of events, while offering great comfort to participants.  But what makes the experience truly unique is the quality of service. The staff showed remarkable kindness and responsiveness from start to finish. Every member of the team – from reception to restaurants, spa, rooms and excursions – helped make this stay an unforgettable one."

        "review_text": "Just about to leave from a week at Sidi Mansour. We got a very cheap deal so our expectations were not too high but have to say, was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is a little tired and the rooms are very basic (no kettle!!) but everything was very clean. The pool area is fabulous and quite picturesque and seeing as most days were spent around the pool for us, this was a big plus.  The food isn’t amazing but we did manage to eat at every meal with no major issues. The salads are amazing! The waiters and bar staff  are all very pleasant and eager to fill up your wine glasses at every opportunity 😂 Now onto the entertainment team. Our holiday would simply not have been the same if it hadn’t been for the efforts from this amazing young team. They work tirelessly from morning until early hours and always have a smile on their faces. They obviously are asking people to get involved in their activities but I would never have said that they ‘pestered’. I generally didn’t join in with a lot of the activities but would get asked and as soon as I said no, they left me alone. I really can’t stress how much they made our holiday. All of the team were amazing but a special mention for Tweety, Inzo and Chris ( not their real names) 😂 who really went above and beyond to bring enjoyment to our days!  All in all, a fabulous mixture of relaxed and activity filled holiday, met some great people and would definitely return for the cost!"

        "review_text": "The hotel itself is a little tired, in need of refurbishment. The rooms are basic and somewhat dated but clean and comfortable. We had paid for a garden view room but the manager upgraded us to a pool/sea view room on the day we arrived which was great until we realised we were above the bar so it was quite noisy at night - and first thing in the morning when the cleaners started work!  Food in the restaurant is ok - not the best for my British taste (no cereal at breakfast for example) but it’s varied so there was always something I could find to enjoy.   All the staff are friendly and welcoming, from the bar staff, waiters,  reception and  cleaners.   This holiday was nowhere near perfect but, for the price we paid, was really good value for money. There’s not a lot to do outside of the hotel but we’d only come for a week in the sun and the weather was perfect for sunbathing round the pool - which is immaculately clean and a lovely space to relax in. The music can be quite loud, except between 12 and 3, but we enjoyed it although others didn’t.   What made this holiday great for us was the animation team - they work really hard to include as many guests as possible in the games from first thing in the morning until last thing at night. They are all characters and are friendly to everyone. A special mention has to go to Criss, Inzo, Abdul, Mario, Nutella and Steve - what a team!  We had particular fun with the newest members of the team, Tweety, who wore some outrageous fancy dress costumes every day and made us laugh with his antics. His name should be Cheeky because he’s certainly that!  The hotel would not be the same without this team of young people working hard to make the guests time enjoyable. Thank you guys.   All in all, we had a lovely holiday. You know the saying ‘you get what you pay for’ and we didn’t have high expectations for what the holiday cost - but our expectations were exceeded, by the friendliness of everyone at the hotel and, despite its shortcomings, I would recommend this as a destination."

        "review_text": "The hotel is in need of some refurbishment but the rooms were clean and serviceable. On the whole the food was acceptable but not very varied however there was always something acceptable to eat. On the subject of the animation team !................ loud, intrusive and seemingly unable to take no for an answer, repetitive loud music around the pool area, constant harassment to join in the \"fun\", impossible to enjoy a quiet drink in the bar at night. On the subject of the beach - it is reached by walking down a road alongside a wall topped with broken glass, little strewn with thousands of empty plastic bottle scattered around along with other indescribable bags of stinking rubbish! Not forgetting the homeless encampments along the way. The area around the beach can only be described as a \"bombsite\" devoid of vegetation and appeared to have been used as a dumping ground for unwanted rubbish. On my visit I encountered a discarded settee, two microwaves and various items of broken furniture, The bar at the Beach is NOT all inclusive and only soft drinks are provided - alcohol is payable. Overall I understand you get what you pay for but the surrounds of the hotel do not inspire. Very few British people in the hotel and all feeling somewhat disillusioned. On a more positive note the bartenders in the Hotel provided excellent customer service and could not be faulted. If you want a holiday where you remain within the hotel around the pool and like to participate in repetative activities and the same in the bar in the evenings then this is the hotel for you if on a budget - otherwise STAY WELL CLEAR."

I don’t go on holiday to spend all my time with English people and they were all very pleasant and friendly.  I found the food very tasty and it was really nice to taste Tunisian food, which is something new for me.  I would have liked a little more drinks choice at mealtimes too, maybe the option of some wine with dinner. I thought the room was really nice and the cleaner did a good job keeping it clean. It had a lovely view over the pool and out to sea.  I also found the animation team brilliant. I always look at the way I am treated as an older person, who can sometimes feel left out of things. This certainly wasn’t the case. I love the loud music and dancing around the pool to the club dances. It what makes my holiday.  I enjoyed the stretching, water gymnastics, step aerobics and Zumba, boules and crazy golf. In the evening the team included everyone in the dancing and they even put on their own little show.  They all work so hard from early morning to late at night to ensure everyone is having fun. Always with smiling faces. I would definitely return to this hotel without a doubt."

        "review_text": "My mum and I stayed at this hotel for a week in May and, despite being a bit rough around the edges, we had a great time and would definitely return.  Depending on when you go, there are not many English people in the hotel. This wasn't an issue for us at all and was something we were aware of because we had researched the hotel before booking. Every guest we met was lovely and we had no problems. If you want a hotel that is full of English people then this probably isn't the one for you.   We originally booked this hotel based on the reviews of the animation team, and they didn't disappoint. The whole team work incredibly hard both day and night to make sure everyone has fun, I didn't find them to be too pushy. They are an absolute credit to the hotel and were the highlight of our holiday.  The food was great while we were there. Although there is a small selection at each meal and sometimes it can feel repetitive, the actual quality of the food that was there was great and I never had a single meal that I didn't enjoy. There was always some form of rice and potato on offer so I think even fussy eaters would be fine. The drinks are ok, although there is limited choice in the main restaurant which is a shame.  There were a few small things that weren't perfect, we experienced water outages twice in the week we there, we had a tile fall off of our bath and often our 'clean' bath towels were stained and discoloured. You also have to pay a deposit to get towels for the pool and for a safe in the room, but this is not a massive issue. The beach wasn't the best, but we spent most of our time around the pool anyway. We weren't given any information when we checked in which is an area I think needs to be improved.   Overall, for the price paid, it was more than worth it. Good rooms, good service, great entertainment."

They tried,   shibo was not at all  friendly ,miserable he Did not mingle with the guests  he couldn't even say hello, The hotel was full of different nationals and  very little English people and it's of my opinion we was not made welcome like others, the animation team are certainly obsessed with been loud and dancing. They ruined my experience.  The hotel is in need of some updating inside and out, food ok, rooms good pool clean sunbeds need replacing , most are broken and uncomfortable.

Two members of  Animation team were just awful, The assistant manager Shibo , he was so rude no costumers skills what so ever. when I asked him why only two English songs were played all evening He shouted and me in front of guests and other Animation team employers AND SAID SO WHAT!!!when I said your attitude is not acceptable he said go and report me. I told his Manager but is behaviour did not improve, in fact when the manager was not there he did not play any English music. I saw  him been horrible to other animation team members.   For the whole of our two weeks stay the evening  entertainment consisted of Dancing and more dancing, we had a hour karaoke, two fakir shows ,30 mins bingo/tombola and quiz, we were badgered into buying tombola/ bingo tickets by the animation partially  Nutella when I said we didn't want  to buy some tickets we don't play bingo she said don't you like the Animation team!!!! and would not speak to us again.  The Arabic music played around the pool and  on the Evening was that loud you couldn't hear your self think, we was been hassled constantly to dance and  join in activities we found that a bit difficult when we was not familiar with the music , sorry the two English songs played every night was free from desire, And the twist!!! They think been loud is important!!! Bar staff/ other staff reception staff were nice. Manager of the hotel was nice . would I return Never."

There were five of us, and two out of five sick! One of the two on infusion!!! Produced to make the fruits fat, it seems or tourista. 30% of the hotel was sick but the doctor said there was no sick. Bizarre.. Do not take ice cubes, apricots, melon, watermelons. Eat only cooked and dry products. Make sure your water bottles are closed. Rinse it with bottle water.  Poor cleaning.  On the other hand infirmary and doctor at the top on site and fortunately! But then take out the blue card... any plan to make money? Getting people sick? Well, I'm not speculating either.  The shop is expensive, thieves. Do not buy at this location.  Excursions took place on the beach.  I advise the Saharan very well. The pirate ship is fine.   Animation-wise, the Djerbians are very strong and kind but it’s only trade! Watch out for your daughters or even your wives because Arna-COEUR! I offer you a gift, I charm you and arrived in France my Big Daughter was receiving messages and she almost got fooled and even my wife who had left her whatsapp.   The animations are good but its young people are exploited no wonder they manipulate. On the spot he doesn't know anything about my daughter and luckily, I think so. In short, appearance and if one does not get seriously ill ok. Otherwise choose a better destination and plan antidiuretics!   On the other hand a positive for the massages, and the staff there, except for the many grazers.  Long live the visa.

        "review_text": "First the view is really great and also the staff very nice. However, the ladies and the elderly gentleman at the reception very unfriendly. The hotel is said to have 5 stars, which we find absolutely exaggerated. You had to balance your bags yourself from the car to the hotel and from the room up the stairs back to the reception. Sorry, but you can't do that. Breakfast is a joke for a 5 star hotel. A cappuccino or a few scrambled eggs, omelette or similar costs everything extra here. We didn't try the dinner. Hence no statement on that. The rooms are nice in themselves but so noisy that you could hear doors slamming especially in the morning as people ran up and down the stairs or the staff swept the pool area in the morning. Unfortunately, it has come of age. After one of the rooms was converted into a construction site one afternoon, my collar burst. But so be it! Conclusion a hotel that really and honestly did not deserve the 5 stars at all. Great location doesn't give me 5 stars yet, there is more to it. There are 4 star hotels in Sidi that are better and I mean no harm. Ah so the reception manager was super nice and extremely helpful, but even he can't change anything if the owners let it slide like that. What a shame!"

        "review_text": "The hotel commands amazing sea views and is well located close to the buzzing centre of Sidi Bou Said. We were there for two nights and overall the experience was good. There are however some issues which ought to be addressed given that the establishment presents itself as a 5 star hotel to an international clientele:  1. Price Haggling - arriving in the hotel was like trying to buy a souvenir from the Medina of Tunis in 1999. The hotel prices are high even by European standards and then you haggle and they give you somewhat better rates (which are still expensive).   2. Cleanliness - the hotel is generally clean however there is little attention to detail. The telephone in the room was filthy. I took it off and gave it to the housekeeper to sanitize it (it needed a dip in an alcohol bath). After some time they returned with the thing somewhat wiped. I asked them to clean it thoroughly and refused to take it back. So the receptionist came back with it saying “all telephones in Tunisia are like this!”.   3. Breakfast - we had amazing breakfasts in other hotels in Tunisia and had high expectations for this hotel. Breakfast is served in a small terrace, not in the restaurant. It comes ready on a tray and consists of tea or coffee, water, some bread and cake served with butter and jam, a cold boiled egg and a tiny bowl of sliced fruit. They also serve the usual Tunisian lemon and strawberry juices in fluorescent yellow and radioactive pink which shout artificial. I asked whether they have some fresh juices but the waiter insisted that these were fresh lol. We asked for cooked breakfast (shakshuka) and the server said they don’t do that. So we went to reception to see whether they could recommend a decent breakfast place. She looked flabbergasted and asked “why??!!??!!” I replied that we wanted a cooked breakfast so she took out a menu and said that they can do it (we still went ahead and had an amazing breakfast at Blu Blu Sidi Bou instead).   4. Recommendations - We asked for restaurant recommendations and they proposed a restaurant which, when we walked in front of, seemed rather brusque. When we got back to the hotel we asked the guy who had made the recommendation whether he was sure of that and he replied smiling “I never been there! I wouldn’t go there! Go to xxx”. Likewise we asked for a taxi to the airport. They said it cost 60dinar (a metered taxi costs 20dinar). We accepted because the hotel is in a pedestrian zone so we didn’t feel like having issues. Before getting into the taxi, I asked the receptionist to confirm the rate, which she did. Once at the airport, I gave the guy his 60dinars (3x his worth) and he started yelling that he wanted 80dinar because we had luggage. I know that the driver is independent of the hotel but they should know which idiots they are calling.   5. Decor - they made a huge effort to decorate the hotel to the extent that the rooms are kitschy. Less is more.  Apart from the above, the Villa Bleue is a good compromise but they should roll up their sleeves and get their house in order if they are after a discerning clientele. One is to bear in mind that their rates are higher and their rooms and services are much inferior to places like Dar el Jeld which exceeds all expectations."

        "review_text": "I’m not usually one to leave reviews but do yourself a favor and book any other hotel nearby. This hotel came recommended from a local friend for the location. We stayed 4 nights - excited for the location and upgraded to their top suite. Unfortunately, we ran into problems almost every day. 2 of the 4 nights our AC did not blow cold air - in 40C weather. Woke up completely drenched in the middle of the night. They kept sending someone to “fix” it but nothing changed. Several arguments, 5 calls to the front desk, and 3 days later, they finally believed us and sent a real HVAC tech to fix the problem. The last day/night an electric problem caused all of our outlets to stop working in the room. The towel warmer shocked us. On top of it all, the hot water stopped working. We’re usually easy travelers and aren’t phased by minor discomforts. But for the amount of money paid ($400USD/night) and this being a 5 star hotel - it was totally unacceptable. The hotel manager spoke to us at check-out and proceeded to give us a lecture on how the AC works (even though there was clearly an issue and they sent an HVAC tech from the nearby town to fix it and admitted there was an issue). She grudgingly ended up giving us 10% off our bill and promised us a discount at our next stay. Sorry, this will be the first and LAST time we stay here!"

        "review_text": "We booked the family suite at La Villa Bleue, but our experience fell far short of the expectations of a Five Star Pension.   Cleanliness and condition of the room: When we arrived, the sheets and towels were dirty. We asked that they be changed, but those provided to us were also stained. The bathroom was dilapidated and a strong smell of pipework persisted. The shower and sink were clogged, and the water stagnated at the ankles when we showered. Despite our complaints, the maintenance failed to resolve the problem, informing us that it would not be repaired until after our Check-out. No other rooms have been offered   Service: The behaviour of the female manager was unacceptable. When I wanted to borrow a book from the living room library to read in the bedroom, she ripped it out of my daughter’s hands saying that books should only be consulted in the living room. I have never seen this in my life after years of traveling. A vulgar and haughty behavior, this person has nothing to do in the hotel industry and has no sense of customer service. I remain shocked by this lack of professionalism and respect.   In contrast, the rest of the staff, especially at breakfast, were friendly and helpful   In short, the establishment relies on its location and the view, but forgets that a Five Star Pension must offer a standard that lives up to its claims. The performance is far from the Award paid. I will never return and do not recommend this property"

        "review_text": "Location: almost at the edge of Sufi Bou Saeed’s cliff, right by a viewpoint with stunning views. You cannot beat the views on their terraces (the breakfast area and the pool area)..  The breakfast area terrace has an unobstructed view of the Mediterranean.   Access to cars: Even if it’s in the pedestrian area, cars have access to pick you up or drop you off at the hotel entrance. However, expect to pay a higher fare, given that you’d have to ask the hotel to call a taxi for you, or, that most Bolt, InDrive transfer app drivers try to avoid driving through the pedestrian area. You can walk through the pedestrian area yourself (a 10min stroll), but not with suitcases (streets in the pedestrian zone are cobbled and can be slippery).   Rooms: There are a few rundown rooms and a few that are not sea view. My advice is to aim for a sea view room that’s been renovated/well-maintained (if you’re staying there, might as well pay extra and enjoy the sea view off your windows, balcony or terrace). Do not count on getting good Wi-Fi inside some of the rooms (depending on the location of your room). But the rooms have safes, are spacious and are clean.   Staff: Wonderful staff! They carry a positive attitude and are more than ready to help with any question or request you have.   Lubna and Reem (at the reception) excel at providing the best service possible. Kareema and Hamza (breakfast area) carry a cheerful attitude while providing a great service at breakfast. Mariam and Afaf (house-keeping) work nonstop at making sure everything is spick-and-span. The whole crew take their work seriously and always carry a smile on their faces and a can-do attitude."

        "review_text": "Despite being in the chic-est town in Tunisia, this luxurious, glamorous hotel still acts as a safe haven from the hot, sticky, tourist-ridden streets on the outside. My abiding memory is returning from a trip to Tunis on the TGM (a real relic from the past and a must for any adventuring tourist) which we had pursued in the midday furnace, with temperatures exceeding 40C. I sprinted through the busy town centre, with the sun still beating down on me, my body dripping with sweat. As soon as I was through the hotel door, I jumped into the beautiful, empty pool, and felt the soothing yet refreshing water washing away all the dust and dirt of our adventure. I stayed there for an hour or so, soaking in the beautiful surrounding views of the Mediterranean.  Location: The hotel is situated away from the tourist-ridden buzz of the town centre, and is instead nestled on a cliff, looking out towards the vast expanses of blue sea.  Food: A good non-buffet breakfast is hard to pull off, but this place does so in style. You can have it brought to you in any location of the hotel, so naturally we opted to have it looking out onto the Mediterranean. All the food is extremely high quality. The restaurant is rather expensive, and food in Tunisia is very well priced, so I'd recommend looking elsewhere. There's plenty of choice either in Sidi Bou Said or in the neighbouring towns, such as Al Marsa, La Goulette or Tunis itself."

        "review_text": "In second place to the beautiful Midoun beach, the hotel keeps the promises of its site. Spacious enough rooms, elegant common areas, large swimming pools and flower gardens, good quality cuisine and very helpful and competent staff make it a very pleasant place for a relaxing holiday, or a more lively family stay. A special mention for maintenance staff, who spend their days cleaning and tidying up the premises. The weak point is undoubtedly the small thalasso center, where massages, otherwise correct, are not always as long as advertised, and the linen of the cabins obviously reused several times in a row! It’s probably better to go and get a massage outside, where there are many wellness centers. To be sure to be quiet, ask for a room in the rear wing, away from the pools."

        "review_text": "Our stay at Hotel Le Ksar was very disappointing, despite a pleasant setting. Several points have greatly displeased us, to the point of questioning the 4 star rating of the property.  Catastrophic animation  Animation is non-existent and soulless. The animation team, apart from one or two people, is totally lacking in motivation and enthusiasm. The activities of the day are almost nil, except for a game of pétanque, and the evenings are of absolute sadness. The facilitators themselves seem to be uninterested, which makes no one want to participate at all. For a hotel in this category, this is unacceptable.  Very limited cleanliness despite a dedicated employee  As soon as we arrived, we were shocked by the state of the room, far from the expected standard. The cleanliness was poor, and this problem did not get better during the stay. However, we found that the maid was doing her best. She was overworked and had too little time to ensure effective cleaning. It is therefore not a lack of professionalism on his part, but a big problem of organization and resources.  A very average, even misleading All-Inclusive  The All-Inclusive service is very disappointing, especially in terms of drinks.  Alcoholic beverages appear to be cut with water, making them tasteless.  Difficulty finding glasses and cutlery repeatedly, which forces you to search or wait.  Low quality and choice for a hotel in this category.  Lack of general organisation  Recurrent problem with pool towels: often broken, forcing holidaymakers to wait or do without.  Often outdated staff: Some employees are helpful and do their best, but they are clearly understaffed.  Conclusion: a hotel to avoid  We already stayed in 3 star hotels in Djerba that were much better than Le Ksar. Between non-existent animation, insufficient cleanliness, very average All-Inclusive and a glaring lack of organization, we definitely do not recommend this property. It is far from the level expected for a 4 star."

The least... Service at the shabby restaurant. It is up to us to find the cutlery and glasses, the tables are never laid. No bottle of water in the restaurant or in the rooms, we have to fill a decanter with water and find an empty bottle and fill it If you wish to have some in the room. The staff is not very welcoming, complicated to have a smile, except the housekeeping staff, it really feels like others are suffering their day. The cleaning of the rooms is very succinct, claim toilet paper, shower gel is not accessible. All inclusive is very limited to soft drinks, and beer. Coke whisky pays as does gin. The animation team is totally non-existent, no animation during the day, except to come to you to ask you when you arrived and when you leave, that's all! We have been coming to Djerba for ten years twice a year. This is the first and last time we will stay in this hotel which is far from deserving of these four stars.  We don't know if there are any officials in this structure, but if they exist it's time to set the bar straight, you're definitely not up to the other establishments."

At the level of activities, Manssour came directly to us as soon as we arrived to offer us full of activities, the price remains reasonable and negotiable , always with a smile. For our part, we did the carriage ride from 9am until 1.30pm, very nice it was great we saw lots of things, we also did quad biking and really it was top!! And we also cameled by the sea and in Berber villages for 2 hours. The + in all this is that Manssour always made sure that we were okay during the activities and especially after , to make sure that we had a good time which was the case. At the catering level, it was excellent, the kitchen staff was really friendly, the only small flaw is that there were often the same things to eat. I recommend this hotel for your holidays you will be extremely happy with your stay!!!"

If you come here as a woman alone, in my case as a woman with a son, you are truly despised here. The first experience in the restaurant, I ask the waiter very kindly if I can order something, he turns aggressively around 'I'm not a machine, you're going to wait!\" In commanding tones. I thought, first experience with the hotel, could be better. I ask for a glass of wine, and put a half full bottle of lukewarm white wine in front of me.... The pictures don't really reflect the actual atmosphere (rather marginally), the food is very limited (not very healthy) and wine is offered in cardboard espresso cups. Had asked in advance to be able to reserve massages or early or later in the day it was all possible, but now arrived everything is full outside in the middle of the afternoon or afternoon.... Fitness is very limited and then paying for this. The drinks menu is very limited. I don't recommend it"

The buffets are varied, with local and international dishes. Some meals lack a bit of flavor, but there is always something good to eat. Special mention for Tunisian pastries!  Day and evening entertainment are friendly, without being invasive. The animation team is dynamic and sets a good atmosphere.  Overall, it is a good value for money for a stay in Djerba.

The animation team is sooooo great, they try so hard. Always laughing even though they have such a long day. Childcare from the hotel is just fantastic. Ama and the other two are just worth gold. We will definitely come back and are already looking forward. The beach is a dream, like in the Caribbean. This time we stayed in the main house, the rooms could have been a tick cleaner. But that's just as a side note.  Also positive to mention is the German guest care of Sadok, mega friendly.  On the beach there are excursions, jet skis, camel rides etc., you can accept this really easily. All very friendly and non-intrusive. Moreover, cheaper than the German travel providers. I have done 2 trips and parasailing so far. All top of the line and really cheap. Price performance top. Distance from the airport 45 to 50 minutes."

However, I had to make concessions on many things during my stay, such as the poor quality of the wifi connection throughout the stay."

He was unprofessional, nor did he have the attitude neither the look of guest reception. The room was dirty, I had to change it ( I found dirty sheets and hair on the bed) the 2nd room was also dirty. The room had AC but they turned it off, the same rude guy from the reception was telling guests that the season for AC has not started when it was very hot and humid in there. They also activate the keycard for 48h then you have to go ask them to reactivate it again. They said the system had a problem but I guess they were doing it on purpose to make people go to the reception just in case. The room service was not on a daily basis and the breakfast was terrible. I’ll never go back."

I provided my card to them and they claimed the machine was not working after trying 2 attempts but was able to provide me with a receipt for the transaction being declined. On the third attempt, they said nothing but told me it was declined without giving me any receipt. They told me to go to the cash machine and pay by cash which I did. A month later I was looking at my bank statement and saw that the card charges have come out of my account. I tried calling them and they said they would refund me in 5 - 10 working days, a month later and I'm in a position where i have paid twice for a one night stay and they are not reachable in any means possible and still no refund provided"

After complaint, kindly offered us another room on the 1st (423) nothing to say except for the bathroom same remarks as that on the ground floor. Unpleasant on Friday we did not redo the room..on Monday at 5am the reception that wakes us up telling us that our shuttle to the airport was waiting for us, while we only left on Tuesday around 1.30pm.. not very nice all this.

The food is fine.  The service at the reception is very nice and always at pains.  Otherwise, there is actually no service here. It's self-service everywhere.   The beach is very nice, apart from the sad horses and camels that are exploited here. They stand all day in the blazing sun to entertain the tourists.  It would definitely have to renovate the pool area as the floor looks and feels like the tiles have been removed and simply no new ones laid."

Too bad that the service of changing beach towels is no longer done in the evening in the rooms.

This hotel is beautiful, immaculate setting, super clean and lovely pool and beach area. Definitely best All inc buffet I've had anywhere, and the beer and wine are lovely. I'm veggie and although always ate so well cghef and the manager offered to cook me anything else I needed. Can't fault it.    The hotel has the usual family entertainment, but guests who may want a busy nightlife will be able to get a cheap taxi to Sousse or Monastir. The Hotel location is in a peaceful area but an ideal base to explore. We particularly liked Monasastir for cafe life and history and shopping!  Bedrooms have a balcony and full bathroom, English TV channels, and fridge. Bring a bottle for free cold water refils. We had the best sleep. Super comfy beds and quiet rooms.   The staff are lovely, particularly bar staff, dining room staff and receptionists.   The outstanding joy of this hotel is Mr Jaleel the manager. He genuinely cares so much about guest satisfaction and will go out of his way to resolve any  issues. He gets so upset when people come home and complain when he would easily resolve issues if only told about them. He's a credit to his hotel and Country.   I can't wait to return  to this peaceful hotel with beautiful beach and great food. Thank you so much to everyone at The Neptunia"

The staff is very friendly, many speak German as well. The manager was present all day and always asked if everything was okay. And, as good food as there we didn't even have in 4* hotels ! The beach is just a dream and is cleaned several times daily. Although we never fly to a hotel more than once we have already booked for 2025. We can only recommend it. In addition, it is now to be renovated further over the winter."

        "review_text": "Were at this hotel in September 2023, were not very happy with the hotel meals, BUT the incredible attitude of ALL the staff captured our hearts and, after visiting in May 2024 the 5* hotel in Turkey unanimously decided that they missed Neptune very much and returned here in September 2024 again  What I want to say, first of all, the manager of the Hotel Zhalel is just a terrific person who knows ALL his guests to their faces, every morning, every day and every evening wonders how the holiday is going, it is very valuable, everything under his control practically 24/7! After a year became insanely delicious food, the choice is small, but there were always fresh delicious fruits, very delicious sweets, fish, meat, mussels (in the hotel 3*:)) , side dishes, tortillas, we ate to the ground (bringing sausage😅 but it didn't come in handy😅)  Whiskey was taken, beer was drunk at the hotel, quite 👌🏻  The room stock is being renovated, the rooms are being renovated, yes, it's not a super suite, but everything is very, very clean and neat 🤷🏼‍’”️ The most luxurious sea view of the rooms  The beach this year was cleaned twice EVERY day, sifted through the sand early in the morning and afternoon, the seaweed was cleaned immediately   We're not quite lucky with the weather, but this item has nothing to do with the hotel😅  Met a lot of guests who were last year (what people are coming back says a lot, I believe)   If there are flights from Moscow, in September 2025😂 we will come again to our soulful nearest dacha😅"

        "review_text": "This was the 15th time I have been to Tunisia. This was my first time at this hotel.  Hotel is spotlessly clean. Maids cleaning from sun up to sun down. They should be paid more! The best advice I can give, tip well. You’ll be treated well.  Mr Jalel (manager) couldn’t do enough for us. I have walking problems and COPD. We had to move rooms a couple of times because I needed air con. Air con wasn’t working in either room. Mr Jalel ended up getting me a floor standing fan to help with the heat.  We were on the 2nd floor facing the sea. The breeze was needed.  Reception staff, especially Abdallah, were extremely helpful. Abdallah can speak good English and was very helpful when we needed a translator. I even ordered a birthday cake for my partner with the help from Abdallah.  Dining room and kitchen staff were also very nice and helped whenever I needed help.  We celebrated a birthday while at the hotel and they pulled out all the stops to make a cake and decorate the table with fresh flowers. All the staff even sang happy birthday. They were amazing!  There is only one downside to this hotel and it was an employee called Adel who took you on excursions in the hotels name to wherever you wanted to go.  We thought he was very friendly. He sold jewellery at the side of the shop and also worked in the shop with the shopkeeper at times. He even took us to atm when we needed to change money. He took us to the medina in Sousse and showed us around. He took us to a rug making shop. We enjoyed the banter from the staff at the shop and Adel. We bought 2 rugs! We brought one rug home with us and paid for the other to be shipped to Scotland. This rug was more expensive as it was a gift for mother in law, who is 85. We wanted a family tree with the names of the family in Arabic.  We have asked Adel 4 times since our return to Scotland regarding when we would receive the rug. We were told to start with that we would get it. Now we don’t even get a reply about the rug."

Great location cashpoint only a short walk up the road and supermarket 10 minute walk  and half the price of the hotel shop. Don't believe what you hear it is safe to go out by your self I went out several times for coffee, cashpoint and supermarket on my own and with another female. Explore outside of the hotel, great nightclub and shopping in monastir, shopping, clubbing and Arabian night in sousse where great. Late night beach parties were also great.

        "review_text": "This hotel is optimised for mass tourism and provides a pretty sterile experience for any traveller who wants to get some experience and a feel for local communities. It is a “resort”, quite isolated about 10 km from Tunis  and surrounded by other, mostly now abandoned, tourist venues of similar stripe. The nearest store is a 25 minute walk away.  Although the staff were very pleasant people, I don’t think the hotel deserves a 5 star label as it displays little by way of hospitality beyond a bed - not even a bottle of water in the room. The buffet is large but ordinary, and it’s wise not to wait too long after start time. I didn’t get to try the sparsely patronised a la carte presto, but the bar was quite good, though understaffed.  I stayed here due to it being part of a package tour, but I would not choose the place if organising my own travel arrangements."

The staff is helpful and pleasant, you wouldn't say warm but... not far away sometimes. MAIS: - no tourist information available at the reception  - Rooms at the end of their life: holes in the carpet, phone and hair dryer that do not work, fairly dubious cleanliness, worn paint, window that can be opened but not closed...) - if you want to have breakfast near the dining room window, you can be turned away because the tables are large and there are only 2, 3 or 4. - seminar in the lobby and on the pool for 2 days: lots of noise  And the icing on the cake: - a swimming team that trains in the outdoor pool all day: howling, trumpets... and makes noise in the corridors at night.  In short, it is a good place, well placed (away from Tunis but close to other places to visit) but do not seek luxury and calm."

The very best of the staff are at the reception Ahlem and Radhia. They always make sure that you are welcome in the best way.  Even during Ramadan, the food is good and tasty as always. However, I missed their own fried bread for breakfast.  The room was good and the cleaning lady had put a little extra work and love into arranging the room.  The stay was short but pleasant.  I'm looking forward to coming there again. A extra warm regards to Ahlem and Radhia  (I hope the Hotel manager is aware and take extra care about Ahlem and Radhia.)"

We had a small leakage problem in the SDB in less than 10 minutes it was settled with kindness and discretion. They have installed a WhatsApp system that makes it possible to reach them directly it is incredible and effective. In addition, after each intervention, a small SMS to know if the request was made and always a reminder about their availability.  The hotel is very nice the lobby, the amazing bar with live music, there is really a beautiful work on the aesthetic of bar that reminds me a little of the American jazz club.   The restaurant is a self, it's varied there is everything. But it remains a self, clean, after it often lacks serving cutlery in sauces or other accompaniments. I didn't see if there was an à la carte restaurant, what was already enough for me. And again it was clean. The orange juice in the morning was troooop good!!!   Our twin double room with white decoration, a very spacious balcony and a view of the entire hotel with the sea in the background, so I think we had one of the best locations for visibility.   And to finish the best for last, my little relaxing moment at the beautician, where I was lucky to be in 2 pairs of good hands with Najla and Dhouha who took care of me perfectly, I extremely needed a manicure and a pedicure, which was executed without any worries, with incredible kindness, in addition to the professionalism found in the execution of my treatments... we chatted a little and again it is always nice to have people smiling and who have a sense of welcome."

The rooms are a little aging but also clean  There is a mini bar in the room extra. every day a room master controls the mini bar. But on the other hand, don’t think to check if the housekeepers hand over water knowing that we are in tt included , clever trick for us to serve the mini bar , medium technique , to go and ask our due to the reception for WATER.   The restaurant has a varied choice at every meal, what’s great is that employees at the end of the shift can serve this which limits waste and at least they work on a full stomach.   Which is to be thrown up. It is to see them serving in the middle of duty in the gastro with their fingers , eating in front of the customer , then serving you with a \"pliers\" , and all this in the greatest calm the chefs of room say nothing , it is moon , eat ok = this make a plate and go in the kitchen is better.   We went to the massage , lame go your way , relaxing massage = make your toes crack and tickle your feet , make your hair scrape no encompassing or relaxing maneuver 45 min to wait for his pass"

The animators are nice but the music at the evenings and too loud and two animators spend their time whistling it's super earsore.  My husband is injured during a slide ride nobody par ali the gentleman who manages the excursions is taking care of us. Forced to go to the private clinic on a Sunday and pay a blind we also had to negotiate the price of 300 euros announced we went to 100 euros to get sewn under the chin. Our belongings also took a bleach for a housekeeper during a pool outing in the indoor pool. The manager offered me and my husband a 30 min massage. That's nice of him. The food is not extraordinary but we always find to please despite the recurrence of dishes. Their donuts and pancakes are excellent.  The hotel is clean and we made quite a few excursion with ali and garcia that really have us more. Despite the waste and stray cats... alive and dead if we ignore all its is a beautiful country that gives the impression of freedom."

        "review_text": "Nothing but praises about our stay at Maia Hotel Suites! The entire staff was helpful and kind and the service they provided was simply excellent. Two examples: The desk agent placed a phone order for food for us, and had it delivered by the security agent, from the restaurant downstairs, on our first night, because we were unfamiliar with the neighborhood. On the day we left, at 3:30am because we had an early flight, the desk agent (different from the first one) came downstairs to check on us after he saw on the security cameras that we were waiting for our taxi! And we had barely been waiting 5 minutes! The three security agents at the door were always cheerful. They provided tips and recommendations that made our 3-day visit even more pleasant. The room was spacious and very clean. Shower, sink and toilet were clean and worked well. Wi-Fi was dependable and fast. The breakfast was copious and delicious. We chose this hotel for its central location and weren't disappointed: 10 - 15 minutes from the airport (depending on traffic...) 20 minutes from the Medina and 20 minutes from Sidi Bou Said. We found taxis within less than 10 minutes each time we left the hotel to visit the city We very highly recommend the Maia Hotel Suites hotel for anyone visiting Tunis.  If we ever come back to Tunis, we won't bother looking for a different hotel."

        "review_text": "Very nice hotel located a short distance from the airport and close to the lake. Nearby there are a good number of clubs and restaurants, the center of Tunis instead is 20 minutes by taxi. The room I was assigned was tiny, they will have been a 10 sq m plus the bathroom also small. The essential but decent quality furniture. More to review the insufficient lighting especially in the bathroom where perhaps, on the mirror is appreciated a better visibility for example when shaving. Nothing to say about cleaning, done well and thoroughly. There are no room services, for these you have to call Glovo and the like. The common areas are very nice and well maintained. Breakfast is served à la carte in a room also very nice and with a very kind staff. The offer, however, is definitely limited, it revolves around different versions of the same omelet, no desserts, honestly after a while fed up. Ultimately nothing to say about the hotel and staff that I can only speak highly of. There would be little things that if put in place would make this structure really interesting. In the end, however, all in all I was fine."

Well furnished rooms, living room with two couches (one is a sofa bed) and a kitchenette, separate bedroom, dressing area with lots of shelves; a mini apartment!  We were expecting a continental breakfast and were surprised by a menu and waiters!  The evening front desk man who checked us in was amazingly hospitable and helpful. He arranged for someone to buy us a bottle of wine (the person had to take a taxi since there is no alcohol in that area of Tunis), brought us ice, and helped us order dinner to be delivered. The phone in the room didn't ring so he actually made three trips up to our room! Over and above.  Enthusiastically recommend this hotel which is a 10 minute, 10 dinar taxi ride to and from the airport."

There was a good welcome on arrival where there was a security check on the ground floor and then we took the lift to reception on 1st floor. Check-in was smooth and it wasn't long before we were given our key card for the suite that we booked.   The suite was spacious with an open plan kitchen/diner setup, large bedroom and bathroom. There was a lot of storage space. There were a few issues with the TVs and a lack of essential items provided in the kitchenette.   Breakfast was served in the restaurant, the menu was extensive and served to the table. A good range of hot and cold items were available and the coffee was excellent. It was a very good stay at Maia Hotel and ideal for an extended airport stopover."

The place is clean and the staff are very nice for the most part. The breakfast is served at the tables, it is of very good quality.  Sadly, what was really problematic for me was the low sound insulation. I was hearing my neighbors talk and move in their rooms, it would wake me up during sleep. While also being annoying in general when sitting in the room. Maybe the hotel will address this in the future, which will make this place excellent."

Booking in was straightforward and not at all stressful. Shown to room without any delays.  Unfortunately we’re not given any information about hotel meal times or anything else.  Room. Clean and tidy and large enough for our needs. Large balcony. Bathroom had a shower over the bath. If you’re a short person may have trouble getting in and out. Only 2 sockets in room really do need more.  Room cleaned on a daily basis. Satisfied.  Restaurant. Food did vary only one soup available at mealtimes but plenty of salad. Food was more for the Eastern European guests. Brown bread was sometimes available but not always. Fruit and cakes plentiful. Good service and clean.  Bar. Good service and good staff. Drinks were the very cheap variety and sometimes ran out of some drinks. The bar area unfortunately wasn’t kept very clean. Quite often the tables were dirty and sticky. Did mention it to the bar manager but very little improvement.  Tea and snacks. Drink machines with paper/plastic cups. Morning snacks croissants, afternoon snacks cake. Bin for dirty cups was often dirty needed a good clean.  Animation. Very good. Entertainment room for improvement.  Pool area. Plenty of sun beds at all times and area kept clean.  Beach. Nothing to write home about, worst beach we have seen in over 50 holidays in Tunisia.  All in all a pleasant stay but could do better. Definitely not worth the 4 star rating more of a 3 star overall."

Reception Area, comfortable seating and air conditioned.  Food, slightly more variety would have been preferred, waiters in Restaurant extremely helpful.  Shop, the man in shop was extremely helpful and provided excellent guidance in respect of places to visit and transport options.  Location, taxi rank situated directly opposite hotel and available throughout the day.  Beach, a matter of crossing the road and walking down a lane. Sunbeds were available at no extra charge."

        "review_text": "Please don't waste your money by going to this place especially if you are traveling with children!!! This hotel was absolutely horrible. Before you pay for this hotel just know that you will be expected to pay about £50 before you get your keys!   We did not have hot water for 3 days and every time we said something, no-one took notice of what we were saying until we asked the manager to give us the rest of our money for the remaining 4 days so we could book another hotel, we even emailed love holiday who were helpful and refunded us a small portion of the monies we paid, once love holiday reached out to them they moved us to another room. Another problem was that their rooms were cold and the heating did not work properly, they gave us a small heater which helped a little, but this was very stressful especially when you have a 2 year old with you on holiday.  The heated pools were turned off, the spa was not open, the were no activities offered like advertised, we had to book a few excursions while we were there so that we wouldn't be sitting in the hotel room all day.  We found over 30 cigarettes buds on the children's play pit, it was absolutely disgusting because I toddler accidentally stepped on one and wanted to play with it, when I reported this to reception, they did seem to care.  The Hotel was filthy and never vacuumed, they only used broom on some areas.   The food was ok, not the best but okay, not a lot of variety especially for breakfast. They \"ran\" out of milk for 2 days so we could not have hot drinks or cereal.  The \"night entertainment\" was an absolute joke, it was just loud noise that they played until midnight, when we asked them to turn it down because we wanted to sleep, they obviously did not listen. Honestly if you advertise yourself as a family friendly hotel then surely you should try to be accommodating to people who will come to your hotel with children.  I loved the island of Djerba as a whole but this horrible hotel really ruined my holiday because it caused more stressed than relaxation."

        "review_text": "Omg where to start, we had booked a week at this hotel in March, it took 3 room changes to get a room that was remotely except able, even then a cleaner had to come in and clean it again, we missed lunch with room fiasco so asked where snack bar was and were told there was a cafe 1/2 a mile down road, tried to get a drink no beer no gin the list goes on. Thank god for some other guests who had some duty free and were happy to share. Food one option so no choice at evening meal so dried up chicken or nothing!!! Breakfast stale croissant not over cooked stale and the best bit you could have a cup of tea if you liked it black because no milk!!!! Everything is closed the indoor pool is not heated, you can’t even enjoy sitting on your balcony as furniture is filthy. We couldn’t stand being there anymore so we were checking out, another couple who arrived same day as us had booked flights home that’s how bad it is. Trying to check out was a nightmare they would not return our tourism tax which we had to pay in cash. We kept asking them to call a taxi but wouldn’t after 2 hours a taxi turned up for some other guest and the driver took us first as we were going round the corner. A cheap holiday should not mean that you can’t expect a clean safe environment or that if you are all inclusive you can’t get some edible food and a drink at the only open bar. As much as the few staff there were tried all they could say was sorry until we were checking out and this became quite hostile.  We are a well travelled couple and have had many cheap last minute getaways but never never have we expect anything like this, I don’t usually write reviews unless it’s a nice one, but I just feel I have to let people be informed of how bad somewhere is that you only stay one night a pay to go and stay somewhere else. In the summer maybe more of the hotel is open but unless some work is done it’s nowhere near a 4 star"

        "review_text": "This review could have easily been a 1 star. However, on reflection, the price we paid was only £34 a day all inclusive, which included the tax you paid on arrival at check-in.  The room was basic but a good size, which included a bath (need to ask for plug as not in room). On arrival, we were given a room with a toilet that didn't flush and a broken toilet seat, which were both resolved quickly.  It was out of season, and the room was cold, so I asked for a heater, which again was dealt with quickly. The food offer is very limited and is repetitive, with most days the hot counter offering food being luke warm in temperature. The bar on the afternoon of day three ran out of vodka and gin on the afternoon of day four with neither replaced until the evening of day five with only whisky and buka available for all inclusive guests even though they had spirits in another bar but were only available to paying guests. The gym has an additional charge and has very limited equipment in poor condition. Reception was very helpful in assisting any issues.  Most staff are polite enough, and the animation team tries to get to know you. It is located within walking distance of a few cafes / restaurants which we thought were good value for money, which was welcome due to food offer in hotel. The hotel is less than 1/2 a mile from the beach, which is not well maintained, and the two occasions we went were mainly occupied by camel rides. The hotel would appear to have been nice at one time, but it looks like lack of investment over time has taken its toll."

This music is played outside at the pool area and also the lower level of the hotel where the dining room is. There is no one ever at the pool, the animation guy playing it is the only one dancing.... it's pure self gratification. It's really an unbearable noise. If you want peace and quiet you will not get it here, not even by escaping to your room.  Food is mediocre, not at all hot, even when coming off the hot counter.  I'm here with my sister and we have been hassled a lot in the hotel. I expect it off site, but please not on the complex. I've been here two days and have been asked the same questions ten times over ie, what's my name, where am I from, have I been to Tunisia before.... please leave me alone on site. This is no way a four star, probably was once, but it's faded grandeur makes it now a two star at best. I would definitely not recommend, even for a cheapie break away."

Effectively beautiful room clean and beautiful view of the pool. But we were not informed of the noise of the evenings (music in depth until the first night 1:30 and the second the day before December 31 4:30) it is only the animators who dance. We were offered to change rooms, but based on feedback from the local holidaymakers, we preferred to keep ours and buy earplugs. Among other things, this hotel is a commercial hotel that complements with buses from Algeria and Libya that only come to eat and sleep 1 night. We had the worst Christmas Eve of our lives. People threw themselves on the food, there was not even a plate or tray. Our meal was for us a bit fries and with paid drinks. Great for an exclusive all.. While on some tables the food was spoiled (their habits do not justify everything) we went outside to finish our New Year s Eve. The restaurant, we are really tolerant people and not difficult, but there from the 1st day to the last day of our holiday it was always the same, it was good without more, not too many choices and the tablecloths are dirty. Do not hesitate to put a little more expensive and but a tip avoid this hotel.."

People at Reception and Restaurant didn't show any face yet.  They have a warm pool if you are here in winter months.  Rest of them are nothing like what they advertise in the site.  Start with Reception.  Such a laid back approach for everyone.  1 hour to check in. Couldn't check In, they gave us the keys to the room and asked us to come back later.  If you are dealing with one person means you will have to finish them before you move on to the next guest, where as here they hopping between three four people.  If you come from Europe then you'll be annoyed to see such a silly actions,  so as in the Restaurant guests have no courtesy stand in the queue,  easily jumping the ques and staff ignoring the ones who stood in the ques and encouraging que jumpers. Coming back to Reception.  Hidden cost of 260 Dinars as Tax, I Never heard such a high Tax for a week stay.  No WIFI IN THE ROOMS. WiFi only available in Reception area.  You need to speak French or Arabic if not Communications are really difficult with the staff in here. No body speaks English.  We were using Sign language.  Everyday we need ask the cleaner to provide gel, shampoo and Towels if not they don't top up Automatically.   HOT WATER ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE MORNING.  At the Restaurant,  most of the dishes were repeated . Never labelled food contents in English,  big struggle if you are vegetarian.  Fish weren't even scaled and Gutted properly before cooking.  Orange is the only fruit available for the whole week.  Hardly seen yogurt on the counter.  It's a  total disappointment.  Hotel needs demolition and re build from scratch get all the bad practices away,  if not Europeans please find somewhere else. It is not a 4 star Hotel. I Don't even give 1 star."

However, every time we leave food on our plate, we ignore a tragic reality: what we waste could feed those who do not have the opportunity to feed themselves.  It is essential to recognize and act on this global injustice. When filling your plate, ask yourself the question: “Can I really eat everything I have taken?” If you are not sure how much, start with a small portion and, if necessary, come back for more. This gesture, simple as it is, is an act of responsibility and respect for those who are not so fortunate.  Food waste is not just an individual act. It is a reality that affects the planet as a whole, and every little gesture counts for a more just and sustainable future. By thinking about those who don’t have the chance to go hungry, we can all contribute to a better world.  Thank you for your understanding, respect for this cause and your commitment.  PS: “The attached photo shows the state of a table occupied by two people just after they left. The waste is simply appalling...\"  With all due respect,   Eric Cherar"

I saw a poster at Reception for another excellent package  - 275 TND for breakfast, lunch, use of pool, 40 min massage, 30 min facial, and use of a suite room all day. There was a 50 TND single supplement but still a wonderful experience for the price. There was a lovely helpful lady on reception called Ghada who got staff to take me to meals (2 different restaurants - the hotel is like a huge palace - art work and marble everywhere). She also took me to my room. Again, Mohamed had everything perfectly organised in the Spa and was kind enough to change the facial until after lunch. Restaurant staff was excellent too, as was the food. One young waiter (with a long Turkish name) went out of his way to make me a \"caffe latte\" (I found the cappuccino from the machine a bit too sweet). The rooms are luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. Everywhere was quiet because it is low season which was perfect for me.  This is a uniquely exquisite hotel with a fabulous Spa and wonderful staff who provide outstanding service. I am very grateful to have experienced being here."

The thalasso center is well organized, its staff is competent and attentive, as well as reception, cleaning, beach and restaurants. The breakfast buffet is impeccable, good coffee machine and real orange juice, etc. The à la carte restaurant, for us included in the half board offers a Tunisian menu and a European menu, starters, meat, fish and desserts of very good quality. Little downside, prefer the à la carte restaurant to the very hearty buffet and with choice, but a tone below culinary level. In total very little extra expenses, water and wine at table at very reasonable rates. We will definitely come back with friends next time.."

The courtesy tray is shameful, cheap kettle that leaks responsible for short circuit, instant coffee when all over the world you find espresso makers. Decent breakfast for a 5 star, already seen better with a neighbor. Not enough material, we wait 45 minutes for a pancake!  No children's club so punished with thalassotherapy if you come with family! The 120 dinars dinner is also not exceptional and children pay as much as adults for 2 slices of pizza and ice cream. No drinks included despite the Award.  In short this is not the luxury 5 star I expected given the fame and especially the Award paid."

Although the hotel is ideally located to access the main tourist areas of the Hammamet region, Sousse or Tunis, there is no need to leave it with what it offers on site such as various services and amenities, s Added to all this is a truly heavenly beach.  Another notable characteristic is the authenticity reflected in the menus. Despite the Mediterranean dimension and diversity in the restaurants, it is pleasant to find real Tunisian dishes with excellent and authentic flavors."

        "review_text": "Hasdrubal Thalasso Hammamet is one of the oldest hotels in Hammamet, and while it may show signs of age, I was pleasantly surprised by the overall cleanliness, large room, and charm it offered.  The hotel's aging exterior might not be the most visually appealing due to lack of maintenance, but once inside, I found the interior well-maintained and quite nice. The cleanliness of the rooms and common areas was commendable, which greatly contributed to a comfortable stay. I wanted to add that it was enjoyable but events which happened during my stay destroyed my enjoyment.  Despite its age, this hotel manages to retain a certain charm,unfortunately some staff is  friendly but some other staff's demeanor adds to the negative experience.  My recent visit to the à la carte restaurant was marred by an unfortunate incident that left a lasting negative impression. While I had initially looked forward to enjoying a pleasant dining experience, what I witnessed was completely unexpected and unacceptable.  During my time at the restaurant, someone decided to engage in public urination, which was not only unsanitary but also highly disrespectful to the establishment and its patrons. Such behavior is entirely inappropriate and should not occur in any public setting, especially a place where people come to enjoy their meals.  I believe it is the responsibility of the restaurant staff to maintain a safe and comfortable environment for all customers. In this case, it appeared that the staff either failed to notice or address the situation promptly. This incident significantly detracted from what could have otherwise been an enjoyable meal. Kamel the server was informed and witnessed the incident but didn't do anything.  I hope that the restaurant takes measures to improve its security and staff training to prevent such incidents in the future, ensuring that customers can dine without experiencing such discomfort.  I must say I was quite disappointed with the level of customer service provided by the receptionist Ghada. While the hotel itself had a luxurious ambiance, the receptionist's attitude was much to be desired. I had hoped for a warm and welcoming experience when I was asking for change, but instead, I was met with a receptionist who was not nice at all. She appeared disinterested, and her demeanor came across as unfriendly. It's essential for a hotel of this caliber to have staff who make guests feel valued and appreciated whatever they're wearing or whatever they look like, but unfortunately, that was not my experience, no smile, no eye contact, not even being regarded as a customer.  Yes that was Ghada who forgot the meaning of the word receptionist.  I believe that the front desk staff play a crucial role in setting the tone for a guest's stay, and in this case, it left a negative impression. I hope the hotel management takes note of this and addresses the issue to ensure that future guests have a more pleasant experience with this lady and others like her.  This is a hotel not a funeral home!  At the Thalasso another funeral home  the person sitting there (Mohammed) was lost was not welcoming and was not even smiling very bad service luckily Hedia saved the day when I asked her to help; her genuine smile and service were very appreciated unlike Mohammed who was indifferent, that person should not be facing customers even if he is the person responsible of the Thalasso Center. Working with customers is an art!  I want to acknowledge the hotel director's Mr Ncir as well as the chief receptionist Leila thoughtful gesture of bringing flowers and offering an apology for any inconveniences during my stay. It was a kind and considerate gesture that showed a commitment to guest satisfaction.  However, despite this apology and the goodwill shown, I must express that the service standards at the hotel remained unchanged. While the flowers were a nice touch, they do not address the underlying concerns regarding the service quality.  I believe that true improvement lies in addressing the issues that were initially raised."

        "review_text": "Royal Garden Palace has its charm, but it's clear that its best days are behind it. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant team – especially the evening shift – was professional and welcoming.  Desserts were top-notch, but beef dishes were a letdown: steaks were overcooked and rubbery, and stews needed much more time to become tender. On the bright side, fish and shrimp were delicious. The Tunisian night and local cuisine were real highlights!  Entertainment options were quite limited, which is a downside considering there isn’t much to do outside the hotel. The crocodile farm is about 3 km away – worth the walk on your own.  The hotel surroundings feel neglected, and while camels and horses on the beach might sound exotic, the mess they leave behind is less appealing.  Overall: a decent one-time experience, but not a place we’d return to."

        "review_text": "As with many hôtels in Djerba the star rating reflects a distant past and there are a few glaring standards that differentiate this hotel from a truly luxury one. Firstly the dreadful all inclusive package  , limiting the guest to really substandard quality ingredients. All cocktails are bulk premixed stock and when served look nothing like their exotic namesakes. My husband and I don't drink alcohol but enjoy a 0.0 beer. Not available at this 5 star luxury establishment and the management refused to get some in for our stay. Even a shack on the beach had it for sale. And finally the indignity of trying to get a sunlounger around the pool. Forget it after 07.15. Despite the hotel clearly scorning the practice of towel dropping they do nothing to discourage it. In my opinion this alone puts it in a 3 star bracket. We are still at the hotel for another week, so will update as and when."

It is representative of the whole pool. Dozens and dozens of reserved deckchairs and nobody in the water   This is abnormal and the hotel does nothing which is even more serious.

Quick cleaning. Separate toilets are fine provided that the flushing system works despite various maintenance interventions.  Carpeting in the floors marks signs of wear, deserves a new hit.   - The indoor restaurant lunch and evening at will: clean, white tablecloth, fabric towel, the buffet very varied but tasteless, except the excellent Tunisian buffet on Saturday evening,  ( 1 correct meal over a week!) If, in the evening, you dine at the first service you will have to forget your aperitif at the piano bar, there is the bar but no musician, (musician will be there when you are at the restaurant)  I hold breakfast with fresh juice minute, boiled egg, various appetizing preparations. Thank you, Murad. - The outdoor restaurant swimming pool open at lunch: impossible to lunch because there are flies. The different pool and indoor bars are very good: the staff recognize the guests and always have a friendly word.  - A special mention and a big THANK YOU in general to all the staff who are extremely kind, friendly, from the reception, to the waiters, pool, maid, passing by the animators:   The welcome with a smile, the nice little word, is what makes this hotel strong but unfortunately it does not replace the shortcomings. I don't forget the massages we probably wouldn't come back to this hotel without"

        "review_text": "5-star hotel that was awarded to us due to work at the Iberostar EOLIA which was our initial drop-off point. Large and beautiful park very well maintained and very flowery.  Reception hall and interior quite classy despite the age of the hotel.  Three small shops present and Moorish coffee with free mint tea. Sellers of outside activities not insistent. Welcoming and very pleasant staff. WIFI throughout the hotel even at the beach.  Large unheated outdoor pool. Wooden deckchair with insufficient mattress.  Heated indoor pool with jacuzzi that triggers with motion detector. Very little sunbed in it.  Very spacious room with good bedding but soundproofing is non-existent.      Separate toilet.  Bathroom with a bathtub which is very high making it difficult to access. Quid for the elderly who are in majority.  Television with French channels via satellite but which picks up regularly. Bathrobe available in the room. Safe and refrigerator stocked daily. Necessary to make coffee or tea. Cleaning done every day.  Main restaurant room on a human scale. 2 services scheduled for the evening at 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. Table numbered and allocated for the entire stay for evening meals only. Rigorous pants. Lunch from noon to 1 p.m. Nice waiters. Very good food but not much variety. Fresh juice at breakfast which is increasingly rare. Fresh bread every day. Outside restaurant next to the pool opens at 12:30.   At that time not open at night and beach bar always closed. Pancakes in the afternoon. Beautiful beach cleaned every day. Sufficient number of sunbeds.  Presence of dogs that are not aggressive but bark regularly. Basic day and evening entertainment without atmosphere. Virtually non-existent animators.   SPA and TUNISIAN restaurant not tested but very frequented.  In summary, this hotel is very quiet but with some charm. Suitable for older people who want to rest. Not suitable for families with teens as this is not a club hotel."

        "review_text": "DO NOT GO HERE.  This hotel made me so uncomfortable I booked another hotel and left in under 24 hours. Do not under any circumstances book this hotel especially if you are a woman.  After the bus breaking down and it taking 5 6 hours to get to the hotel when we are checked in the room is dirty with no towels, ants and a coating of filth on the bath. Additionally, the balcony door shudders when “locked”, the room is so old and dated looks nothing like the pictures.   I complain to the front desk, we are accompanied by three different men into the room asking what is wrong with it which was very uncomfortable and meant I just said “oh okay my bad”   We decide to just ignore the state of the room and go to get food, it was outside of the usual meal times. We tell the lady on reception that travel took 6 hours from the airport and were hungry. She says there is pizza, and directs us towards a corner of the main reception area, no pizza in the hour we were around. So we hadn't eaten since our 5am pre-flight breakfast and it was 5:30pm.   The main reception area was very outdated. The front desk was sticky and dirty. There was no aircon so the room was incredibly stuffy and hot, it was the only place you could get wifi which was agonising as you had to sit in the heat with no breeze to have any signal. No wifi by the pool or in any of the rooms.   The reception area was primarily filled with men. These men (we later realised) worked for the hotel. They were congregated at the tables, bar, the pool table and always staring. It made the reception area even more uncomfortable.   We then go to get a drink and are chatted to by who I assume is the owner, trying to flog various things to us to spend extra money. We decline. He then walks us outside, gestures to another staff member pointing at us. We sit down, the man he gestured to approached us. He is the hotel's trip salesman. He introduces himself and spends more time looking at my breasts than my face, I then covered myself with my shirt very obviously and he does not stop eyeing me up. He then asks if me and my brother are a couple, I say no, he then insists we are a couple. I say \"that would be illegal, no\" he then insists that by the end of the trip we would be a couple which made us VERY uncomfortable. We walk away refusing to buy anything saying we will find him if we are interested   ⁠I go to reception and ask for towels for the pool. You have to put a cash deposit- I have no cash- they refuse to give me an alternative option or direct me to an ATM so no towels (we still do not even have towels in the room at this point)   The salesman then returns again an hour later. He continues to stare at my breasts I tell him that we are not interested to buy anything he then says he just wants to be my friend. He then insists to be careful here and watch out not to trust anyone because \"it’s not safe here but you can trust me of course.\" We then leave freaked out and hide in our room.  We left for another hotel first thing the next day."

        "review_text": "We really liked it here. Overall, the hotel would need renovation, but for less demanding people this is not a problem. We liked the food, there wasn't a day when we couldn't eat. But maybe it could be a problem for more demanding and picky people. Special thanks must go to the animators, who made our vacation even more enjoyable and were able to entertain people despite the not always favorable weather. Apart from the hotel, the beach was perfect, that one was one of the main reasons why we chose this hotel. However, this hotel is definitely not suitable for people who prefer a more \"luxurious\" vacation. But we were extremely satisfied and we will certainly be happy to come back when there is an opportunity. However, we consider it a disadvantage that time passes much faster here, and out of a 7-day stay, we felt that we were only here for 3 days. haha :)"

        "review_text": "Me and my partner stayed at this hotel for a week in the beginning of September, we enjoyed our time here as it was a very cheap hotel. However our time we had there, the hotel lacks its basics, we had to keep going up and down to reception for either towels or toilet rolls, and we had to tell reception multiple times about our sink in our and none of them really seem bothered. It’s more of a 1 star than a 3 star. When we arrived our room wasnt ready yet however this was ok considering check in isn’t until 3pm, but the most annoying thing was the 2 sales men trying to sell excursions and also massages, these were both very over priced and they really hassle you coming up to you everyday, at one point before we got our room we had them both sat with us, luckily the customer relation lady who was thankfully English saved us, her name i think is sophia, very lovely! The hotel is about a 2 and half hour transfer, so dont book if you want something closer to the airport. There fore there is some good things about this hotels which was the food which we enjoyed everyday, we just didnt enjoy breakfast as its like a cattle market in there. The animation team are great, always getting you involved! Unfortunately though we wont back."

Little point to improve: wifi accessible in the rooms as on the beach 🙏🏻 is essential to be able to return and reconcile: work and relaxation in your beautiful environment.

The selection of food was really large but also tasty, sweet cakes, fresh fruits and cold juices contributed to my meal. The hotel staff, from the reception to the waiters, are very kind and nice. Special praise for the not good but the best waiter who was always available is Chiheb Eddin, smiling, cheerful and always at the service of the guest. Also, in addition to clean rooms, wonderful staff and workers in the hotel, there are also stars of the hotel, the animation group Schibo, Kiki, Ayman, Chef, Hossem, Mimi, Soula and Khoulound. They made my vacation better, taught me a lot of dances and kept my attention the whole time and no they are not good they are the best team. I will return to Tunisia again for them.See you son 🫶."

Without forgetting of course the invasion of tiger mosquitoes whether in rooms, swimming pools, gardens and even restaurants, so bring a powerful repellent. only positive point is the beach."

Lots of pigeons around the rooms. Safe paying 1€/day. Tourist tax very expensive 28€ / person for a week. All the staff at the hotel are very helpful and kind. Beach at the foot of the hotel, not very large. Lots of seaweed. Hotel located about 50 minutes from the airport. Zarzis small town where there is not much and where we are docked all the time to buy. Food at the hotel of medium quality and not very diversified, my friend caught the tourista after 2 days. Nice but medium animations. Change of euro in dinars possible at the hotel reception. Beach/swimming pool towels available for 10€ deposit per towel.  We won’t come back to that."

Many thanks also to Kali, the manager of Coralia, for his availability and constant attention.  The entertainment team also deserves special mention: dynamic, professional and always smiling, they contributed greatly to the success of our stay.  The diet is good and varied, we do not eat the same thing twice.  The servers are at your disposal to offer you the best possible service.  And it is without counting on the team of the spa area that has been great too.  Everything was perfect. If you are planning a trip to Tunisia, we highly recommend this property.

Their ingenuity in organizing games for children and adults is acceptable. They can create an unforgettable atmosphere, and their participation makes the vacation even more successful. Thanks to them, we say a firm \"no\" to boredom! Animators are not only people who organize games and fun, but also friends who make sure that everyone feels good and has something to do. Their creativity and are contagious, and a vacation with them is a guarantee of great fun and lots of memories. With joy They always involve everyone in their activities, from morning gymnastics to evening performances. They are the ones who make the vacation an unforgettable adventure, full of energy. The hotel is fine, the rooms are fairly clean, which is a big plus. The staff tries to keep things tidy, and cleaning is done regularly. The food at the hotel is good. Breakfasts are tasty and varied, lunches and dinners are also at a good level, with a varied menu. Overall, the stay is pleasant, and the value for money is appropriate."

I would like to make a special mention to the team of photographers, Dhia and Elias, for their remarkable professionalism. Always present, but never intrusive, they managed to capture the most beautiful moments with talent and good humor.

I had half board: breakfast and dinner. The first day, the waiter asks you: do you want a fresh lemon juice or strawberry (without telling you that it’s for a fee) and he does it with all foreign tourists but not the locals. So you find yourself paying for a drink full of sugar at 10 dinars (a fortune there). So beware, if you are offered this in the morning you will know that it is 10 dinars. I have seen scenes where foreign parents take juice for the whole family while it is included in breakfast, they then find themselves paying 40 or 50 dinars.   Unpleasant reception (a man in his fifties with glasses) he takes people from above and shouts at customers. Just surreal scenes.  Private beach away from the Inn. We have to walk and especially find her...   I'm not coming back to this Pension."

Particularly delicious to find the words that would describe the flavor of this dish ...  the masfouf is far from being provocative, he challenges you with finesse especially the pepper that overloads the masfouf with a lot of confidence and grants him an authentic visual. The heart of the matter is a journey into a universe of flavors from which one cannot detach: delicacy, an amazing dosage of spices so well balanced: a feat! As for the dry ones, they are in total fusion with the masfouf ... you close your eyes and it is the sea that immediately settles in your imagination ....presumably the Masfouf aux secs is evocative and crystallizes everything that Djerba can offer to its visitors: a unique alloy and without equal of authenticity and openness. Congratulations Chief, Congratulations to the entire Toumana Gardens team!"

The good: a beautiful pool yard   The bad: my room was derelict, renovated well over a decade ago. The AC did not work, dampened the floor, everything. The “welcome” desk was the coldest in my 50 years travelling, no courtesy.   The ugly: in Tunez there are no private beaches, but the government rents them all the way up to 3 meters from the water. We seated in the beach with the same name as the hotel, we were expelled by 5 guards. The hotel reception never gave us direction on which was their beach, when I told them what happened, no apologies, they did not care.   Summary, one of my worst experiences as a tourist in over 148 countries."

        "review_text": "Maybe I live on another planet, but I really didn't like this hotel. The rudest staff ever especially Jamal at the front desk who charged me the local tax for an extra night when I wasn't staying there and kept the money for himself. I have been travelling in Tunisia a while and this was the worst hotel so far. Yes, my previous two hotels were luxury 5-star but I had stayed in other 3-star hotels during my trip. The positives. Nice grounds and setting. Clean. Huge room like an apartment with a kitchen area if you want to cook anything. WIFI worked well. Now, why I didn't like it. The room was like an oven. There is air conditioning but this didn't work well and mainly flowed in the lounge area rather than the bedroom. I struggled to sleep. It was cooler outside! The bathroom was very basic. No complimentary water provided. There is a small supermarket opposite the hotel and what appeared to be a coffee shop but other than that, the area is pretty dead with nothing around. You need a car or a taxi to move around. My room rate did not include any meals but suggest adding them. As I said, there is not much around. I included breakfast and had the buffet dinner twice during my stay. Breakfast was a basic buffet, but adequate with breads, pastries, an egg station and more. Not huge at all but enough. Coffee was awful. The dinner buffet was fine. Again not a huge selection but enough. The food was nice but skip the desserts, too sickly sweet. Drinks are not included. Cheap. They have an à la carte menu too for dinner which mainly includes Western dishes. I got a little bit annoyed with the waiters as they kept hovering over you when eating, watching and all I wanted was to be left in peace. On my first night, I was encouraged to have something from the à la carte menu but why do I want to have pizza and pasta when I can have that at home? Go for the buffet. Reception staff were unfriendly and never greeted you. My stay was meant to be for 4 nights but I checked out after 2 and went to another nicer hotel. There is a small swimming pool as well. Not for me."

The meals are simple but very good and the catering staff are adorable (special mention to Aziz and the evening service manager whose name I forgot at the restaurant and to Ahmed at reception). Very spacious accommodation and cleaning is done every day. However, the paints in the bathrooms should be refreshed. We were full board and that doesn't include any drinks (not even water). I just find it a shame that a bottle of water was not offered when we arrived with the heat. We had to go to the bar to buy some. You can easily get around by taxi for very little money and go to the Géant to do your shopping. I also recommend the Tataouine excursion with Omar (who you will find every day at the swimming pool) much cheaper than that offered by the Tour operator (FTI concerning us) and exactly the same thing (we found the Tour Operator bus at each stop...). However, we heard people complaining about the other excursions offered by Omar, to see... We booked a tour of the island by taxi with FTI: very friendly driver but who stopped us in shops where he received commissions in Houmet Souk... In short, if you want to relax, you've come to the right place, even if personally, I would have appreciated a little atmosphere in the evening from time to time without it being a big fiesta."

Our unit was huge— bedroom, sitting area and kitchen (minimally equipped)but with refrigerator and microwave) A patio made for good sitting in the early morning or evening.  The food was great, both the buffet and when ordering from the menu. The waitstaff were friendly and efficient. We enjoyed the pool for late afternoon swims. The beach where there were chairs and umbrellas is a short walk.  Daily maid service.  This is a resort to which customers, mostly French and German return to year after year. While it may be a little warm around the edges, for the price and spaciousness of the accommodation it earns our 5."

        "review_text": "I was there during corona outbreak. Services were limited. Meaning every day clean towels, once a week they supposed to clean the apartment and we had to take our own plates away after eating. Not so bad. However. Apartment when I arrived was dirty. In the kitchen were all over black spots of humidity. Certainly on and in the freezer. It was very noisy. I had the bad luck to have a neighbour who couldn’t lift her feet and had no control over her hands while closing doors and windows. Moving all the time the furnisher which made terrible noise. I asked for another room and although everything was free as there were no much guests they offered me a room next to 3 people. I didn’t move and asked to at least talk to that woman. They did not.  The food was delicious. Excellent cook. Excellent kitchen team. But : the man who served, Kamel, was awful. Breakfast supposed to be till 10.00 o’clock. When I came around 09.00 I had to wait till he wanted to serve as because of corona, you were not allowed to serve yourself. Understandable. However in the 4 weeks I was there I only have had maybe 7 times a croissant as they were already taken by the other guests (we were only 8 in the morning). Then around 09.10 the waiter started to be nervous. He wanted to go. Once I said to him that it supposed to be open till 10.00 and the answer was “Madame, we can’t stay open for only 1 client”. Even a second cafe in the morning was not possible as everything from the buffet was gone at 09.15. Obviously he decided to close at 09.30hrs so he could walk along the beach. I felt very uncomfortable and after a couple of days I decided not to come at all anymore for breakfast. Telling it was too early for me. From then war was signed. He served reluctantly in the evening and didn’t speak to me at all anymore. I supported that for another 3 days and decided to leave.  Yes I had a very bad experience there.  I wouldn’t have written this if I didn’t hear from workers there that I wanted to have a vip treatment. That I wanted to have breakfast from 10 till 12 which is not true.  As I have severe long and heart problems I only asked to not smoke in the dining room which they did every evening. The answer I got was “but it’s my friend the doctor “. If that makes any difference. Then the cats. They were all over the place. They jumped on the dining tables, were sitting next to guests asking for food, we had to take our own plates away and the cats were licking them. I took pictures to proof all that. When the kitchen was closed during the day the cats were playing on the sinks. With my own eyes I saw that. When I said something about that, again the same server, responded “but those are our house cats”. Unbelievable !! And in fact very sad that a man like that server has a year contract there l He’s lazy and doesn’t want to do anything more than obliged. Ahmed ? He knows too and he said it was allowed to smoke at the reception and apparently also in the dining room. Cats are allowed too. Jumping also out of the garbitch bag (which gives you a heart attaque) next to the place you have to put your plates.  I wanted to have a VIP treatment ??  Shame on you to tell that everyone of a client !!  Signed : Madame Corona (then every time I tried to talk or say something Kamel said “mais Madame, Corona...”"

The rooms were spacious, clean. The buffet food quality varied from ok-to-great. The front desk service from Ahmed was exceptional - he helped us out with any questions, swiftly. Ahmed connected us to a local tours guide who got us great deals on a dromedary tour and a dune buggy drive. The spa had fantastic deals on massages as well, which was great for spoiling the whole family. Lovely pool. The only real frustration was that the Wifi was unreliable in our room. We recommend that you visit here with your family!"

It would be nice if there were more local dishes on the snack menu.   I was told they have a private beach, yet when I followed the signs to Toumana Beach it’s just a dirty beach at the end of a road. There’s quite a bit of garbage and animal poo. The resorts on either side do a better job at keeping their beach clean. This area also has A LOT of seaweed in the water and on the beach. It’s definitely not the beautiful turquoise water I saw in pictures. I found the beach by La Marsa (near Tunis) to be much nicer.   As for the hotel, on first presentation, everything looks nice - reception area, pool, room. ...but upon closer inspection is when you find flaws. The walls in the room had yellow and brown stains. The towel and bed sheets had stains. Room WiFi had no internet access because the network jack wasn’t active. Lights outside room didn’t work. There’s a kitchen in room but few utensils and no dish soap. The reception staff didn’t seem to care and often seemed slightly annoyed at having to help you. The guy who worked the evening shift was particularly bad. I asked about getting a bowl to use in the kitchen and he said probably not but he’d check. I knew he wasn’t going to bother checking. I also asked about getting the lights outside my room fixed. Similar response - he’d check, but I knew he couldn’t be bothered. No one working there knew the password for the outdoor WiFi (it had a different password than reception WiFi).   If I were to go back, I think I’d try to find somewhere by a nicer stretch of beach."

The reception staff was rude and childish. The parking was horrendous (only a small stretch in front of the door that could fit two cars maximum). The massages sent me to my chiropractor. The food made street food look like five star cuisine. The cleaning crew used so much bleach it would give a passerby a migraine.  I would have rather slept on the street.

Food was generally very average. Our room was lovely, a suite overlooking the pool, but we had issues with towels: they took them away when they cleaned the room but didn’t replace them with clean ones unless I went to reception to ask; on the penultimate day they also removed the dressing gowns and I had to ask for these to be replaced. The pool was often crowded in an after as it seems they sell daily access for 60TND which many locals take advantage of. The room was listed as all inclusive on booking.com but only soft drinks are included so it clearly is not all inclusive. All in all, we didn’t think we got value for money at €300 per night.

Since the revolution, times have been hard in Tunisia and are only just recovering, unfortunately the Nour was suffering as the resort was very quiet. There was no AC on in the reception, bar or dining room, which made it very uncomfortable. A request for a beer was declined at the outside bar in the afternoon but I am unsure why. It may have been Ramadan or just closed but food was available. As we finished our meal, the table next to us received beer and wine! This review is based on the situation in August 2012 and things may well improve as the country gets back on its feet and the tourist return. The other aspect is that this resort is predominately French, so take that as you find it."

        "review_text": "We arrived at the hotel and the staff were waiting to take suitcases. We went for lunch first and then back to reception to be taken to our room.(we requested the ground floor in an email) The room was ground floor and in the main building. The room was great, with a large bed and a huge shower. It had a fridge and loads of cupboard space. The staff in the restaurant for breakfast, lunch, and dinner were great and very attentive to our needs. Always there with drinks with a smile. The food was very good, and even someone who's fussy could eat here. The gala night was amazing. The food was so special. Roast beef , potatoes, and prawn cocktails.  The bars were great as well. A different specialised cocktail every day. There are 3 bars. The beach, pool, and lobby. All the staff are amazing in these. The pools are great as well. The quiet pool was great for me. No kids, no music and no mobiles. The pool is cold and very clean. The main pool at the pool bar is good. The top half is warm and the bottom cold. This was the main area for most of the activities. Water polo and aqua aerobics. There had darts and other games. The animation team is fabulous. They always said hi and would always have a kind words to say to you. I have to give a shout out to MoMo he is brilliant and so funny. That man has more energy than anyone i know. I had my birthday here and the restaurant manager did everything to make it so special. I had a beautiful chocolate cake with candles and the staff sang to me. I had lovely sparkling wine(that was pretty ordered by my fiance) chilled waiting for me. This hotel is a fabulous place to go in tunisia. Now for the bad stuff. Some of the equipment could be done with an upgrade. The darts and board. The flights on the archery arrows.  Now for the unsung hero's.  The cleaners this place is spotless, and the cleaners are always about cleaning the restaurant toilets and everything. The gardeners this place has some beautiful scenery."

The food was one of the best we have had at an all inclusive hotel. The drinks were good (although we could not get drunk for love nor money) the bar staff in all three bars were really good. We like to have a drink and relax on the balcony in the evenings and they would even provide us with a tray for us to take our drinks back! The animation team were brilliant and really engaging with everyone! Big shout out to Steve, Azza and kris, i dont know where they get their energy from!!! The waiters in the restaurant were very nice, even by the end of our two week stay getting our drinks on the table ready for us to eat!!  Only side really was no air-con as its seasonal and the same for the bbq restaurant. It would have been nice to experience that. All in all a fantastic 2 weeks."

        "review_text": "From the moment we arrived we were just amazed by this beautiful Hotel and its amazing staff! We had not been to Tunisia for many years and this time we were just blown away by what we experienced! An immaculate hotel kept clean by a fantastic housekeeping team. The beach is just like a Caribbean experience,  a big thank you to Mansour Mohammed the life guard and the Security guys on the beach for looking after us, they are really special guys.  The food was some of the best we have experienced on any holiday and we travel on average 3 times a year.  Plenty of choice every single day and a Salad bar which was amazing! The Restaurant team are a fantastic, Mohammed MTIR a waiter on the outside terrace looked after us, this man is credit to the hotel. The Beer, Wine & Cocktails were really good and our men are really fussy with their beer but they said it is the best they have ever had whilst o  holiday.  We only saw 2 shows and found they were not for us and we did not partake in any daytime activities but the show & activities teams were very pleasant. When we arrived we were the last coach transfer to be dropped off so guessed that we would be 1st pick for our return journey which turned out to be correct as they were going to pick us up at 5.20am for a 10.20 flight !, we sourced a private taxi for 100 dinar (£25 approx) which was worth it and we were still the 1st in the airport check in queue! Would we return to the Delfino beach hotel? Absolutely YES!  We love it and are already looking to return later in the year. Just a couple of little negatives: The air conditioning was not on at the hotel as its seasonal,  the A La Carte & bbq restaurants were also not yet open,  I understand that there has to be a cut off date but the option would have been an added bonus but these little niggles do not spoil our experience in any way, a massive thanks to management & staff for a brilliant holiday!"

        "review_text": "We’ve just spent a week here and honestly had the best time !  The staff were all so lovely and helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The grounds of the resort were beautiful and really well maintained. One morning I was sitting in our room’s garden and one of the gardeners picked some flowers and gave them to me. There were also a few cats and kittens on the grounds which we loved ! My husband had a great time at the buffet at breakfast, lunch and dinner and had 4 plates each time. The private beach was nice, and our room also had a sea view which was great. I spent most of my week by the quiet pool, and really appreciated the peacefulness of it. Our room was very clean and spacious.  I always try to write a balanced review, and with that in mind there are a few points I’d like to mention, however these are in no way negatives and wouldn’t stop us from staying here again. I am unfortunately a picky eater, and while there was plenty of food, it was a little limited for me, however I am aware that being a picky eater is my problem, not the resorts ! Our bathroom did at times have a bit of a drain smell, but nothing that opening our door and getting some fresh air into the room didn’t fix. The room was quite western, and I had been hoping for more of a Tunisian theme. One of the spotlights by our bed didn’t work, and the other had fallen out of the socket. Part of the fixture on the bathroom door was loose. The water is obviously treated so has a chlorine taste/smell so some more bottle refill stations around the place wouldn’t go amiss, using so many plastic bottles felt quite wasteful. The resort is quite isolated as my husband found during his walks, there wasn’t much around and the area was quite dirty and smelly - obviously does not affect our opinion of the resort. There is a supermarket and pharmacy about 15 mins away.   All in all, we had an amazing week here, and would definitely recommend staying here !"

The black and white dinner was brilliant. Food was as very good. Especially for our very fussy 17 year old who lives off chicken nuggets and chips.

We had an fantastic spa experience would definitely recommend, the girls at the spa are brilliant and really made us feel special & very spoilt a good price too. The only advice I would give is bring pounds/Euros to change at reception as the card machines are rubbish. 10 dinars work out about £2.50 5 dinars about £1.25 We used to tip waiters/bar staff a couple of times throughout the day.  We had such a relaxing chilled week we are booking again for next year."

The baby cot proposed for our 4-month-old daughter had a broken bar, dirty because of the hair present. The rooms have not cleaned properly: there are always traces left on the sink EVERY time, the sheets are not changed but reused, the bed is not always well made. We ordered breakfast in bed the first morning .. catastrophic: we had a complete assortment of buffet offered downstairs certainly, but everything was mixed (butter, strawberry jam, honey apricot jam on a small plate...), the pastries are poor qualities, the bread is hard. The air conditioning does not work at all: the nights were excessively hot and therefore unpleasant, the only window present barely opens so it was impossible to cool the room. I put a star because it is not possible to put any stars: I do NOT recommend at ALL, the price charged by the hotel for the stay is too high compared to the quality proposed, I strongly advise against: if you want a good stay in Tunis, avoid this hotel and everything will be fine!"

The bathroom is big as well. It had a mini bar, a kettle, and a TV. In the morning, I had breakfast there. It was varied and tasty. The staff is also friendly and helpful, especially the lady in the restaurant. The location is good and very central. There are plenty of shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants around.  The only bad thing was that there was a horrible smell around 6 am. coming from the air-conditioning. It was so strong that it woke me up.  All in all, the stay for one night was OK, and you get what you pay for, and for that budget, what they are offering is excellent."

The room was a nice size. It wasn't 100% clean if you properly check the floor. Even though you get a cleaner daily. It seemed, it was not even hovered. The bedsheets and pillow cases smelled like domestos everyday, which bothered us to sleep. I think they use lots of bleach but not fabric conditioner. People were probably smoking in the rooms and smoking was also allowed in the bar so we were smelling it from the 5th floor. Breakfast was good enough. There were same things every day but it was enough for us so I can't complain. The location was perfect, close to the restaurants and old town(medina). It was also very safe as there were so many police officers around 24hrs. Reception contacted me when they couldn't see us until 8pm. It was very nice of them that they cared about us as we were two ladies. Overall we were satisfied with our stay. I can definitely recommend this hotel and if I plan to go to Tunis again, it definitely will be the same hotel in terms of staff and location. Thank you for everything 🙏🏻"

The rooms - we had a triple - are large and functional. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom is large and well organised. The level of hygiene is also good and the breakfast included in the price is varied. The only thing that could perhaps be improved was the Wi-Fi signal in the rooms. The reception is open 24 hours a day and for those traveling by car there is a secure paid car park not far away. Advised."

The hotel did not mention anywhere in the booking process that marriage certificates have to be provided!

It is outrageous to me that they did not ask about this in advance because I almost wasn't able to find any other accommodation due to the incredibly short notice. I am assuming they wanted to charge for a second room seeing that the hotel was empty at the time and they were offering discounts on booking.com"

        "review_text": "I was on the sixth floor and the room was okay, very average really, with no free water or tea making facilities. It was not particularly clean and neither of the two room safes worked.   What was particularly depressing was breakfast. The restaurant is tucked away at the rear of the hotel, a badly lit room with no windows and nothing hot to eat except toast. Very disappointing.  Something to be aware of  at the moment is that the hotel is situated next to a government building of some kind, and taxi's cannot park outside he hotel, and have to take pot luck, which means a considerable struggle if you have heavy luggage. Although not the hotel's fault, they are certainly very quiet about this on the website.   They are also very very reluctant to accept credit cards, and are more than happy to pretend to take payment and 'decline' you card, to force you to produce the cash."

Everything was good, from the cleanliness of the rooms to the amenities provided. The staff were also very friendly and always had a smile on their faces. One staff member in particular, Oumayma, was excellent and went above and beyond to make sure that my stay was comfortable.  The only downside to my stay was that the restaurant could be improved a little bit. The food was decent but lacked variety and flavor. However, this did not detract from my overall experience at the hotel.  Unfortunately, there was a power outage during my stay which lasted for a few hours. This was quite inconvenient but it was not the fault of the hotel and they did their best to rectify the situation as quickly as possible.  Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at IBIS hotel in Tunisia. The staff were great, the rooms were clean and comfortable, and despite a few minor issues, I had an enjoyable stay."

        "review_text": "Rooms are very small and very basic, like a jail cell with one very tiny window. Rooms temperature is controlled by the management so they choose if you get air conditioning or not. So when it’s hot outside, your room is very very hot too but when you tell them, they act like it is the first time they are hearing it; don’t be fooled, they know exactly what’s going on.   Service in the front desk with the exception of two people is completely non-existent and you have to try very hard to get service and responses. The girl in the front desk with the black hair is usually smoking in the back office and playing on her phone and the restaurant staff have to tell her to come out to serve at the front desk. The other blonde haired girl, her name starts with A, is very mean and rude to most guests Omar and Asma are very nice. Housekeeping is super slow and not organized.   Restaurant staff provide no service at all, not even a greeting. If you ask a question, they clearly are not happy to be disturbed from playing on their cellphones. They hide in the corner and gossip all throughout the meal service and play on their phone.   It is not walking distance to the Old Town, it’s quite a walk so be very prepared to walk or take a taxi. Use Bolt Taxi and drop the price 3 dinars if you want to negotiate a rate.   Airport to hotel from departure area was about 7 dinars but you can get it at about five dinars.   Food is horrible at the hotel but they do serve an overpriced breakfast buffet.   Outside it is very Sandy and dusty."

We were placed in a family room communicating with our friends and asked from the day after our arrival to change rooms.We were promised the change of room within 24 hours and we still wait.We did not force our request too bad for us.  Same for airport transfers to the club you will make many stops to pick up other tourists at various hotels  You can easily check in and take a solo taxi it is easier.  Also no pick up at the airport for our return  We had to be met at the airport for our check-in and again nobody  As for the hotel, air conditioning is in operation mid June, gym closed swimming pool not heated.  You can't change before 10:00 in the morning, not very practical when you go on an excursion at 8:00.  For the positive the catering is good , room staff , housekeeping , our friend Tyson as well as the photographer are on top.  So a big disappointment for FRAM We are still waiting for a call following the changes in flight hours that we will be told we can not help and the same for the room.  Where's our FRAMISSIMA?"

The complex is well maintained, the beach is fantastically beautiful and the food varied and delicious. We were particularly surprised by the diversity of the buffet.  However, there is one big minus: the noise. Even before 08:00, renovations begin with loud hammering and drilling – it is impossible to think of sleeping in or a relaxed morning routine. Unfortunately, we were not informed in advance that rooms were being renovated. It was not clear at the time of booking or on the website that construction work was taking place.  The hotel itself has a lot of potential, but this lack of transparency regarding the construction work unfortunately significantly clouds the holiday experience.

        "review_text": "My first visit to Tunisia since 1988(!), and my wife's first visit ever. Having inadvertently fixated on the Canary Islands in recent years, we fancied doing something a bit different for a long weekend, and as I had read that Easyjet had recently started a new route to Djerba from Manchester, we decided to spend the weekend there!  After an early start on the Friday (up at 2.30am!), we breezed through Manchester Airport (not necessarily always the case!) followed by an uneventful 3-ish hour flight down to Djerba. Upon arrival we were through immigration formalities in minutes, and with only hand luggage (always, it's the only way to travel!) we met our pre-booked private transfer driver in arrivals, and were on our way within 15 minutes of landing.  The main \"Zone Touristique\" (I'm sure you don't need my help to translate that!) is around 30km from the airport, so at North African taxi speeds that's about a 25-minute transfer.   We arrived at the hotel and were immediately drawn by the impressive architecture. As would be expected in this part of the world, the Moorish influence features heavily, quickly reminding you that you are in a region whith a lot of history and a some interesting stories to tell!  Once we had checked in and received our welcome drink (something sweet and orange, don't think it contained alcohol) and our All-Inclsusive wristband, we were taken to our room, which we found to be of a decent size, well presented, and light and airy. TIP: The Tunisian Dinar is a closed currency, meaning that it is not permitted to take any of it out of the country. As a result, you can't exchange any in the UK before you leave, so if you want any notes for tips etc, you need to use an ATM at the airport on arrival. The exchange rate currently is around 4 Dinars to a UK Pound, so a 5-dinar note is worth just over a pound, 10 about £2.50 and so on. Unfortunately we hadn't factored this in, so we didn't have anything to tip our baggage porter.  Having unpacked, we wandered to the restaurant, where we quickly discovered that the choice of food was huge! Lots of salads, various meat dishes including stews, couscous, curries, as well as a whole section for (whole, occasionally filleted) grilled fish, a pizza station, as well as various unidentifiable bits and pieces. All of it is labelled in 3 languages (French, German and English), but not everything translates directly so sometimes it was a bit of a roulette, especially for myself as a non-meat eater. Quality of the food was excellent, and the desserts were spectacular, and there were SO many different choices. My only gripe with the food was that sometimes it wasn't always as hot as it should have been, but that tends to be a pitfall of any all-inclusive buffet. In the grand scheme of things it certainly wasn't a massive issue.  The waiters were all excellent, very friendly, always happy to help (of course, this is their livelihood, and happy guests tend to be more generous when tipping!). Local beer, wine, water (and soft drinks, if required) were all available at mealtimes and we plentiful. If you asked for 2 glasses of wine the waiters would just bring the bottle anyway, so it was as easy to just ask for that! Each waiter is allocated a small area of the restarant to work, so you quickly get to know who is who. We tipped each waiter that served us, giving 10 Dinars per meal, which seemed to be well-received.  The entertainment was not really our kind of thing, but as it happened in the only bar open in the evening, we became a part of the audience anyway! Again, included drinks were available, including wines. beers and a selection of cocktails (we didn't try any of these). \"Premium\" drinks, including higher quality wines, were theoretically available, but when I tried to buy a bottle of Cabernet I was told that all the wines on the menu had sold out! So we just stuck with the free Tunisian offering instead!  The hotel grounds were superbly maintained, and the terrace right next to the beach was a great place to sit and enjoy a drink in the sun (in an actual glass, rather than the default of a plastic cup that often happens in All-Inclusive resorts!). The beach itself provided sun loungers and parasols free for hotel guests to use, and was patrolled by a security guard who kept the local salespeople at arm's length. Beach towels are gained via a nominal deposit at reception, via a voucher which you cash in at the hotel shop, where the owner will attempt to sell you whatever he can, although he was never overly pushy and it was all very good-natured.  In conclusion - A really nice hotel, spotlessly clean, staff were all superb, surprisingly good food, the beach was great, the grounds were great, Djerba generally is an excellent place to spend some time. We will definitely be back, and would not hesitate to use this hotel again. 10/10 from me!   Final note: Again, regarding Tunisian Dinars. The security folks at the airport tell you you are not allowed to take Dinars though to departures, where the only cash accepted is Euros (Cards are accepted). Numerous travellers were randomly spot-checked at the gate, including their wallets being checked for Dinars, which were confiscated if discovered. So spend them BEFORE you get to the airport!"

        "review_text": "Hotel in free fall. I stayed here for almost 3 months from the beginning of November 2024 to the end of January 2025. This hotel is located on the beach. The terrace is the most beautiful part of this hotel. Although the service here is ok, the beach bar is ripe for the wrecking hammer. The outdoor pool and indoor pool are also ok. The rest of the building is in need of a total renovation. The rooms are old, everything is worn out, bathroom (shower in bath without handles) is a danger to the many elderly persons staying there. No heating in the rooms in winter. Smoking is allowed inside around reception / bar and in the morning before cleaning it smells like an old cafe. When the weather is, exceptionally, bad, it rains in many places inside, including in the restaurant. The food is decent. There are some hard-working friendly people working here but both in the reception and in the restaurant and just about everywhere there are a lot of misogynistic handsy machos, there is no professionalism here and in some places, such as the animation team where there are a lot of friendly, professional young people working, there are also aggressive people who really should not be in contact with the public! In my case, I was harassed by Ricky, who seemed to get away with everything because you can't count on any help here as a female customer. Nevertheless, mainly due to the sunny weather I had a wonderful time  Although Djerba is a lovely island to spend the winter I can't recommend this hotel for female singles looking for a quiet stay..."

        "review_text": "I had a great holiday, everything was perfect and the food excellent. Mimo, Louis, Nina and Salma have been exceptional facilitators, always dynamic and involved. However, Riki and Mike, who claim to be animators, are a real disappointment. Their only concern is not to animate but to sell , and harass customers by wanting to sell bingo at 120 dinars (see + at the head of the customer) and personalized items at +80 dinars, especially Mike. Their behavior is shameful and petty. Reki spends her time watching the animators, analyzing and staring at women including my fiancée, which is totally unacceptable. Moreover, he only dances with young people and lets the “interns” take care of the elderly, which is deeply disrespectful. Mike, on the other hand, does nothing constructive except force sales, and openly insult “fat” customers “who will explode” during cooking classes. We were outraged to hear that he was trying to sell his fox scarf (with dangling legs 400€ to a hotel guest).  These two “chefs” are incompetent and behave like opportunistic salespeople, totally disconnected from the role of animator. That doesn't respect customers. Fortunately Mimo, Nina, Louis and Salma are professional, caring and really involved in the well-being of holidaymakers."

It was dirty, the carpet was torn, there was no light in the bathroom, and although we were two friends, we were given a room with only one double bed. When we showed the video evidence to the reception staff, they offered us a quadruple room on the first floor, explaining that all rooms on the third floor needed renovation (so be cautious when booking). The new room was clean and acceptable for a 4-star hotel. We didn't have a minibar, and despite daily complaints, it wasn’t resolved. Eventually, the staff admitted that many guests had the same issue and there was nothing they could do. The food was varied and hygienic but lacked taste. There were long lines of people waiting to be served as the hotel was overcrowded. The pool was unclean until our last day; it appears they only clean it on Thursdays. The big waterslide was also out of service for our entire stay. The after-dinner entertainment was just music playing, with no dedicated staff or activities like in other hotels. The staff generally lacked hospitality, with the exception of one woman at the reception who was very kind. When we chose this hotel, we expected a better experience. Overall, Tunisia is a beautiful country, and that’s what we really came for."

The hotel is still beautiful on the outside, the gardeners do a great job...the environment is very soothing. Here everything is huge, so you never feel on top of each other. The restaurant offers a wide choice of dishes, grills, salads, desserts... just a few yogurts are missing at lunch and in the evening. The rooms are very spacious and very well equipped even if the weather starts to do its work, some elements would perhaps need to be renewed and some local decorative objects would be beautiful to immerse us totally in this country. For a 5* it really lacks a wellness area offering various massages or even a hairdressing corner. The immense plus, and most important for me, of this hotel is the staff, that I love them these people! they always take care of me, they pamper me from the first to the last day. This is my second home and my second family. Many thanks to the whole team and especially to Cherif, Nizar, Marwen and Faiten at the reception, Amel, Abnour and Osama at the restaurant, Leilà for the room, Djamel, Sem and Sabre at the pool and the beach....they do a great job very professional, they always have a smile, they are of an extreme kindness, they anticipate the needs of customers and they have their hearts on hand.

        "review_text": "I originally left this review 3 days ago and wrote it while sitting in reception of hotel. In that review I criticised senior management and the food served within the restaurant, also criticised other areas. Early evening on day I reviewed hotel, we were in our room when we got a phone call inviting us to a meeting with the Manager/ Director of hotel. We sat in his office for 30 minutes where he took notes of all our grievances and promised things would change. To be fair to the Manager he only took up his position 6 days ago.  In the 3 days since original review, we have seen a huge difference in lots of areas, there are more waiters round pool area and service is now excellent, no waiting for over an hour to get a drink.  The food has improved with more variety, it is not perfect but it is definitely a lot better and continues to improve, keep up the good work and improving.  This hotel has some amazing hard working staff, who are very friendly and always welcome you with a warm smile. Hopefully the new management will continue to support the staff and keep improving things.  Finally, I just want to say, that my review was genuinely how I felt at the time, the hotel picked up on it and reacted positively by reaching out and listening to our concerns then decided to do something about it. They have turned a negative into a positive within 3 days."

        "review_text": "Very amazed at the super positive comments (fake?) Almost non-existent service, repetitive meals, little choice and no generosity (no local dishes, couscous boils down to semolina plus dry chicken), no butter, no ice cream for the children .. The list goes on! Laborious supply for everything. Identical for room maintenance and towel renewal. 1st bedroom, smells of sewers, second room given super dirty, had to request a cleaning that was most summary. Communication is difficult. Otherwise the hotel is beautiful, the beach is beautiful and allows for long walks."

There is a lovely sandy beach on the doorstep with camels and horses walking along for rides if wanted, along with jetskis. The 24 hour bar was lovely and relaxing but for more family entertainment then to go to the sister hotel next door where a full animation team worked hard to amuse everyone day and night. The pool was lovely but unfortunately too cold to use as the weather was unusually mixed, but the heated indoor pool was a godsend. Thank you for a lovely stay!"

        "review_text": "Excellent services, Tunisian specialities with every meal  infrastructure and sumptuous garden, luxury! super clean hotel friendly and welcoming staff. Housekeeping: no complaints the hotel is running at less than 10% of its capacity, so it is empty (did the Ramadan period scare tourists?), so we are extremely pampered! There are two small comments, though: 1° hammam and sauna not hot enough (incidentally on the 4* beach orange trees nearby, it was the same,  2° to enjoy the entertainment why not post a program in the 5* for sports or evening services of the 4*? which would avoid having to leave the hotel, iron the gates, take a piece of road then enter the second hotel again, this being not practical we could not see what the animators were doing in the evening. The heated indoor pool is certainly more pleasant to 4* (sea view and it is less the oven than in ours, whose water is above 34 °!)  At this time of Ramadan, businesses are closing earlier than usual, which is the one and only drawback.  We took a few excursions: - Hammamet (the old medina): bof... let's say it's the real Tunisia! ....(not the universe of our 5*) - 10 dinars one way or return by taxi, we get a lot of seaweed! - Hammamet Yasmine: a nice clean medina, this one is worth a look (10 dinars one way or return by taxi) - Sidi Bou Said; not to be missed, by privatized taxi 50 euros the half day, a drink with coffees of delights: 2 teas with raw almonds and small piece of cake (12 euros), a good memory! and not excessive. - Nabeul market on Friday morning by privatized taxi 50 dinars: not to be missed, here we are in the authentic! -Show Sheherazade: great and worth it. Thank you all.  Cathy er Eric room 1204 from March 15 to 22, 2025. I will keep a very good memory of this hotel, and will not fail to praise it to colleagues and relatives!"

The staff is lovely contrary to what we could read. Special mention to Lamia and the gentleman of the evening shift who pampered us.  Our room was very nice.

Service almost non-existent in February and limited buffet. No ice cream, no dates, no fresh mint, no snacks between lunch and dinner. Pool bar closed already before time. Oven off and no pizza for the little one, no cream for on pasta.No table set outside at lunch, forced to eat inside. We tried to have a Mojito in the evening but since it didn't have mint, we couldn't drink one.   Staff at the reception unpleasant. The agency had confirmed that we could enjoy the 4* which is part of the same The Orangers directrion but we were kindly sworn in as it was impossible to have meals in this hotel where we could eat out near the beach.  The PVC slats in the hotel aisles were broken and we could have hurt ourselves.  Access to the panoramic terrace by the beach was not prohibited while slats were missing on the access steps. No mattresses on the beach. It's like the hotel is still closed. It is better to take the 4* hotel cheaper and offers more services than the 5*.  Agencies have no knowledge of the change in the management of the hotel which was taken over by the son and this hotel has lost its prestige from a 5*"

Always on the room, being forced to claim every other day for bathroom towels is painful. The large glass door did not close (8103) on a security plan is not great but in winter it passes. Leakage of water on the ground when using the shower.  I specify that this suite was otherwise perfect with a nice view of the sea. This hotel is fantastic, I don't know if there is another this quality in Hammamet. Very nice staff, quality restaurant, unlimited drink even at the bar.  Summary: almost perfect!"

        "review_text": "I have just returned from a stay at the hotel \"Les Orangers Garden Villas & Bungalows\", an establishment that boasts 5 stars, but unfortunately does not deserve them. Here is a detailed look back to help you make an informed choice.  Pros: Infrastructure: The hotel is visually pleasant, with well-kept gardens that bring a beautiful atmosphere. Service (in part): Special mention to Mouna at the reception, to the bartender by the indoor pool, and to the young woman who prepares pizzas. Their dedication and professionalism deserve to be recognized.  Cons: Rooms and facilities:  I opted for a deluxe room, but it did not meet my expectations at all. The elevator was dirty, which is unacceptable for a hotel of this standing. To access the indoor pool, you have to leave the room block, which is impractical, especially in winter.  Bar and choice of drinks:  The bar is a real disappointment: very few choices (only one wine available!), no basic cocktails like mojito, and the quality of drinks on offer is poor.  Restaurant:  Hygiene: This is the most shocking point. Mosquitoes invade the dishes, and I even found a dead fly on a cake. Unacceptable! Meal quality: The dishes are bland, very small in quantity, and of undignified quality. Breakfast is a disaster and dinner is even worse. I had to eat out to get a decent meal. Understaffing: One chef for a whole restaurant, which leads to endless wait times.  Lack of activities:  If you are looking to enjoy entertainment or activities, pass your way. This hotel does not offer anything interesting at this level.  Management and Customer Service:  Following numerous complaints regarding hygiene, meal quality, and service, the butler showed no responsiveness or commercial gesture. Yet we were there to celebrate a birthday, and he was perfectly aware of our discontent. The butler eventually acknowledged our criticisms but, instead of acting, he simply asked us how he could help. Managing customer satisfaction is his job.  I am a connoisseur of luxury hotels in Tunisia, and this is the first time I have seen such a gap between expectations and reality. I strongly advise you to look for other options if you want a real luxury stay with good products and service to match.  Final note: 2/5 (for infrastructure and some staff only)."

Comfort is there... with just one downside for me. I was just coming to cool off. I had asked for a room with balcony or terrace (= garden level). I had my garden but perpendicular to the reception car park.  So from 6am (or much earlier for departures excursions or airport) we hear the staff arrive, deliveries, buses arriving or leaving, taxis. It's not a big deal, but for a non-city girl who's come to seek calm, it's a pain. Especially since above I have young people whose heels walk (I asked nicely if they could be careful, but hey, we don't do it again)  So if you want absolute calm, I don't know which rooms to ask for. I was in the 1006.  And for people with reduced mobility it is not very well thought out either (noticed and confirmed by a holidaymaker that it bothered)  However, remember that the hotel is worth its price."

Drinks were also super all original imported drinks also the cocktails were mega.  Room was clean and top modern.  If you are looking for peace and quiet you will find here as hardly any music or animation is played.  Super service on the beach and at the night bar ( Skander) is the best and friendliest waiter who is looking for him will find him:-)  All in all the staff are very friendly and always eager.   Less good: Too bad we found that with this class of hotel unfortunately there were no welcome drinks what we knew so far from many other 5 star hotels and there you can really follow something.  Since we arrived earlier, the hotel was not attuned to us and we had to wait longer than even normal.   Unfortunately no hotel management or briefing on site (where, what is and when etc.... ) but only when you have asked.  Service is super just unfortunately too few staff for what is offered.  In the restaurant, the coffee or teaspoons were used up very quickly ( small amount ) and most often you won't find any.   All in all, a sweetly meant 8 out of 10 points.  Would we come again? I think so:-)   Thank you very much"

So those who criticize him think of the price paid. Cheap, you can't expect luxury.  Certainly it is rated 4 stars but it was at the time of Ben Ali, now it is the state that took it back and therefore made with the means of the board. Meals are good, entertainment every night (karaoke, mousse evening, fakir...) You have to bring your bath towels back, do not expect to have them. The beach is very well maintained but unfortunately it is 1km from the hotel.  This is the third time I have returned because at the price paid it allows me to spend a week in this hotel and a week in a luxury hotel."

You have to get off when the elevators want to work well. We remained stuck in the elevator which could no longer open. We had taken the all inclusive but difficult to have cocktails and impossible to have ice cubes for 3 days. C was reserved for the bar d next door that paid him. The waiter served us drip and I had the impression that the rum was cut with water. Alcohol is not served in front of you so no way to check. In terms of food it is correct but quite spicy and quite repetitive."

Eyebrow hair removal she depilated me with a razor, blow-drying she botched me and left me to finish alone at the straightener so much it was swollen, they laugh at you!  Don't waste your money!"

Even though the flight was delayed by several hours our transit was still waiting for us. They kept the dining room open so we could have our dinner. I had read some dreadful reviews (after I booked, haha) but seriously?  At these prices, why are you spending your holiday taking photos of broken tiles in the bathroom when you could be enjoying the sunshine and drinking a pretty nice rose by the pool? 100% will be back.

With this opinion I call on the management of Mediterranean thalasso golf in this case Mrs. FATEN MANKAI KSONTINI to take the necessary measures and directives so that this kind of behavior will not recur for a good image of the establishment and tourism Tunisian as well as the hospitality of the brother Tunisian people. Regarding the hotel ,like my previous opinions nothing but nice things to say: Hotel very clean to the last detail. Clean room redone every day. Delicious and varied catering  Two clean outdoor swimming pools  Green garden and dance  Not to mention the kindness and politeness of the staff especially those of the restaurant and bar Yasmine. I hope at my next stay in early October 2025 that this kind of behavior will not be repeated for a quieter vacation than this one. Semani kamel room 10038. Attached is the booking voucher."

The purpose of this letter is to express my thanks and gratitude for the great hospitality during my stay at your hotel.  I would like to thank you in particular for several points that had a great positive impact on my stay:  1. The overall service at your hotel was of a very high standard. The management crew was so attentive that I felt like their friendship. The service and reception were excellent.  2. The food and drinks at the three meals were excellent and tasty. The variety of dishes and quality gave me a special treat.  3. The cleanliness of the hotel in all its sections, especially the rooms, was gorgeous for view. This situation is a sign of your professionalism and constant attention to keeping high standards.  4. The activities and games in the pool and the beach were fun and diverse. This section really helped to have fun and enjoy my vacation.  My stay at Mediterranee Thalasso Golf was undoubtedly one of my best experiences and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. I also hope I can stay at your hotel again in the future.  Thank you for all your efforts and dedication to delighting your guests.  With respect and appreciation,  [Dian from Kurdistan]"

        "review_text": "Felt the need to review after reading some negative ones! Just returned from 10 days here with EasyJet holidays. Lovely hotel. We had a refurbished room, one of the ground floor bungalows. Very nice room. Only issue was the hairdryer is one of those old fashioned ones in the bathroom. Not very good. I recommend you take your own if you want a good blow dry! Lots of work going on to update the hotel and gardens. Quiet pool lovely in beautiful gardens. No issues with getting sun beds. This is not an adults only hotel although not many children.Staff were lovely and no problems with us being English as some reviews have suggested. Waiting staff in restaurant particularly friendly. Shame they have no names on their uniforms. The food is what you would expect in an all inclusive hotel. Fruit, cereal, cheese and meats with bread and pastries at breakfast and eggs any way you want. Some interesting local dishes. However if you want a full English breakfast you will be disappointed. Lunch and dinner similar. A couple of stations with freshly cooked meat, usually Turkey escalopes but sometimes steak and king prawns. Always pizza and pasta as well as local dishes. Lots of lovely salads. Best desserts we have ever had! Well done pastry chef! And lovely ice cream. Wine very acceptable, I liked the rose and my husband the red. Spirits came with Schweppes mixers. We ate once in the a la carte. Set menu and no choice but lovely food. Nice to be waited on. Good entertainment in the bar in the evening and hotel next door if you want something livelier! Four pools including one indoors. We visited the Crocodile park which was interesting and taxi ride cheap! Some shops selling designer copies -bags, T shirts etc. just outside the hotel. All in all a lovely holiday."

Welcome and service: Perfect nothing to say warm staff with quick check-in, quick response to our request.  Cleanliness and maintenance: Clean room impeccable linen and towels.  Clean common areas.  Well maintained garden and swimming pool.  Comfort of rooms: Comfortable bedding , standard size room, wifi present in the rooms.  Hotel facilities   The hotel has several swimming pools including a setback saltwater pool that I personally prefer. The hotel also has several bars and restaurants with a livelier side to the Djerba Aqua resort hotel and a quieter side to the Caesar thalasso, I find it interesting, we are not bored!!  Catering: Frankly varied and good catering it's hard to say the opposite. Snacks available between meals.  Internet connection: Stable connection but medium speed, enough to browse and send emails.   Value for money: Very good value for money for location and services   Overall experience: Very pleasant stay in an idyllic setting. Ideal for relaxing in the sun special mention to the bartenders of Caesar Thalaso (men and women),   Only the receptionist at night called Fatah who almost ruined our stay, this gas should not work in contact with people , it is not courteous to say even mean, but except that we made very warm encounters that made our stay very pleasant.   We will be back with pleasure."

        "review_text": "I will try to be as clear as possible, I go to Djerba several times a year, and I have already done many hotels on the island. The Venice is a man-made hotel, where you feel right at home, it is friendly and the staff is caring for you. The on-site massage center is cheap and the masseuses really professional (I have tested about thirty centers for several years)  Maye, Jean Mouloud, Tigana and Zizou are really super nice! The rooms are spacious, and the wifi works very well. The bathrooms are a bit old, but very clean and we still have hot water. The buffet and smaller than in very large hotels, but it changes with each meal lunch, evening and the next day. You can go there with your eyes closed, as a couple, with friends or alone, you will not be disappointed. Like what, 5 stars or 3 stars, in Tunisia, this is not always a criterion to look at. Look especially at the reviews and especially the most recent ones. Have a good trip to you and enjoy on this little paradise island. Bruno"

        "review_text": "We went for a short break to Hari beach club and i wasnt expecting much due to prior reviews but in all honesty it wasnt that bad. At the end of the day you get what you pay for and at £400 all inclusive for a week this place was worth it.   The rooms were clean and air conditioning worked perfectly. Food was a bit the same each day nothing amazing but nothing too bad.   I must say during my time here the staff were excellent especially Dali who worked the tables bringing drinks out each night and Walid the waiter during meal times - they went above and beyond what i expected.   one tip i would give is use the indoor pool we used it everyday when we was there and we were literally the only people in there!    outside of the hotel there isnt much to do so we decide to do the 4x4 berber village tour on offer by easyjet - it was a long day and the tour was given in French so you couldnt really undertand much of what was going on but one of the other guides in a different car on the tour spoke english so he could inform us ( i would just note this when booking tours as it wasnt explained to us by the rep that it was the case so we had no idea at all in the berber village when another guide took us around what was going on - and at £320 for 4 of you its a bit disappointing and then you get a meal when you are there and the manager there started to shout at one of our group because we wanted to sit together not have 4 people split between other tables )    We then decide to do the Pirate ship tour ... if you have every done one of these abroad before its nothing like them ... it was so bad it was good ... honestly go book it and find out for yourself   all in all it was a good holiday just to get away and switch off ... would i visit again maybe the staff and entertainment were great ... the rooms and food were good.   p.s tip the staff 10 dinar here 20 dinar there its not a lot of money but its makes a big difference to them"

        "review_text": "Last minute getaway before our main holiday in September.  The Hotel is more a 3 star rather than a 4 star.   Positives:  Rooms need freshening up but were always cleaned every day.  Towels changed daily.  Good choice of food at all 3 sittings and snacks available in the main bar during the day.  The pool area was tidy and also the beach was raked and cleaned every morning (we knew there was a problem with seaweed before we arrived).  Kharim did an excellent job of ensuring everyone got a sunbed where they wanted.  We paid extra for a partial sea view - my daughter had a fantastic room directly overlooking the beach and sea.  Negatives:  Smoking!! Previous Hotels in different parts of the world we have been to have designated areas for smokers away from people who do not smoke.  Not at this Hotel.  There were signs in the main bar saying no smoking but people just sat and smoked and vaped, even when there were children around and even babies.  Our clothes smelt of smoke even sitting outside.  The main culprits were staff members sitting at the bar smoking and they remained unchallenged.  Air con was not working in any part of the Hotel or rooms, so some nights were unbearably hot and stuffy.  The internal phone system did not work either so we were unable to contact our daughter in another room because the WiFi did not work outside the reception area. *WARNING* for anyone taking young girls with them to this Hotel.  A member of staff asked to see my daughter's phone (it's one of the new iphones) .  After looking at it he asked her to open up Whatsapp and proceeded to put his number in the contacts.  We did think anything untoward at this point, so when he asked her to send him a test message she did.  Little did we know, he was then going to send her inappropriate messages over the next couple of days.  This spoilt our last 4 days as she wanted to avoid going anywhere near where he was.  It's ironic because there are posters everywhere warning about child exploitation.  My daughter is actually late  20's but she does look a lot younger than this.  She has blocked his number now but should he try other means to contact her, we will have no choice but to take this matter further.  I am hoping management takes note of my comments and filters this to their staff, hopefully making this person think twice about doing it again."

        "review_text": "The hotel is not a 4*, more 3* in my opinion. The hotel is dated and does need so.e refurbishment and painted areas to be refreshed. I appreciate that this is a costly and a huge job. All of the hotel is very clean. Our room, which was in the main building, again was clean and was adequate in size and bright. But the bathroom was dark with poor electric lighting and rather small. Marble around the sink was cracked, and the bath had an overhead shower. Always hot hot water and a good flow of water. The balcony was quite small with a table and 2 chairs. We paid extra for a sea view, but the view was blocked by a building and overgrown plants hanging into the balcony area. Food was always good and tasty and a good variety of choices at every meal time. The bar was a lovely area, of which half of the room smoking was allowed. Small bar area, but we found the choice of drinks to be small with only 4 spirits on the AI menu, and they, in my opinion, were undrinkable. The pool area is lovely with plenty of parasols to go round. The beach we found unpleasant and untidy. Needs a dramatic clean up across the sand. Entertainment around the pool - the music is way too loud. At times me and my husband could not talk in normal voices to each other, due to the loudness. The entertainment team seemed to please & interact with  some people but completely ignored others. They welcomed us to the hotel the day before we left. Staff are OK, but not the friendliest we have encountered in our several visits to all areas of Tunisia. Accept for the lovely lady who works in the hair and beauty salon. I had my nails re done whilst there and she was just such a delight and a breath of fresh air. Sadly for us on our final evening, they moved to evening entertainment to the outdoor area, but sadly too, the nightclub/disco too. As this area was less than 50 yards from our room at 2am I tried to call reception, but the phone did not work and I had to go down to ask for the volume to be turned down, as we had to be up in 3.5 hours for our departure home. The music was so loud we could feel the beat of the music through our pillows. The balcony doors were not the best fitting doors and made no difference to the volume if they were open or closed.  We enjoyed our stay but would definitely not return"

Thank you to Dali (bar staff) for helping my disabled mum all week. Reception staff are very helpful and welcoming. Restaurant staff are very hard working and are happy to help with anything you need. Cleaners and maintenance keep the place clean and tidy. I’ve had the time of my life and not once did i ever feel threatened or unsafe, there was no inappropriate behaviour towards me as a young lady, like i have experienced in other countries. We were here at the same time as a serious accusation was made towards a member of staff THIS IS UNTRUE. As a family we witnessed what happened and came forward with our statement of what we believed to be true. You do not have to worry about anything."

My Room is right on the beach and lovely to sit on the patio reading a book with a coffee with the view (pic added) staff are very welcoming and friend and nothing is to much bother for them. Food is very varied and there is always something different and new on the menu every day. Ice cream bar at lunchtime is a nice touch you don’t see in a lot of hotels, always 3 or 4 different flavours to choose from and it’s proper tasty not cheep rubbish. Room are real nice with TV shower fridge freezer. Local shop about 4 mins walk is great for snacks to keep in there. Shop on site is a bit over priced and was warned by others before I went in there so didn’t bother.  Read a bad review below about a woman getting dragged to the beach by staff. Believe me IT NOT TRUE. The guy was a bullsh&tter. The woman in question was actually being helped by 4 members if staff taking her to the front entrance to wait for the ambulance after she fell and broke/fractured her leg while drunk like she had been for most of her stay. DO NOT let this review put you off. It’s a lovely place and i will most definitely be coming again later in the year. I sincerely hope this puts your minds at easy about whether to choose this lovely place right on the beach."

Momo, staff of animation and Wajih in the bar  for their warm welcome and exceptional service.   They were always friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.  One thing that made this place stand out for us was that pets are allowed.

Varied and tasty food (good Italian chef). Unforgettable the evening of August by the pool. SPA to try! The room was large, bright, clean and tidy. Thanks to all the staff and in particular to the kind Youssef, who has always taken care of the table service in an impeccable way, very professional, attentive and helpful for our every request and need."

Food in my opinion very good, the dinner buffet much more varied and higher level than that of lunch, very rich breakfast for all tastes.  Small beach compared to the capacity of the hotel, given the low season we have always found a place on the beach without problems but I think that in high season it is a real struggle to grab the gazebo with sunbeds and this could negatively affect the stay. Same for dinner out, in theory the table should be booked but being in low season there was always room for everyone which I do not think is possible in August, this is a great shame!  The animation guys very good and easygoing, engaging but never intrusive.  ONLY negative note mattresses and pillows, very hard mattress and pillows of very low quality, I highly recommend the property to provide because they are really bad. Very nice sea."

We stayed from September 9 to September 23, we start from the wonderful sea with a white beach and comfortable sunbeds with gazebo. VOTE 10  During the day you never run the risk of getting bored, given the various activities carried out by the animation team, we personally enjoyed the Beach Volleyball and Beach Tennis tournaments organized by Diego, but during the day you can also choose to play games on the beach. Water fitness, bowls tournaments and more  Thanks for the chat Andrea and Camilla.  VOTE 8  On the excursions organized by Veratour , we recommend the very beautiful Carthage one with a super-trained local Guide , while with Faid and Ciro you can choose an excursion from the hotel with camels , horses and buggy to visit the fortress .  VOTE 8  Inside the structure if you want to relax there are a spectacular massage center, we have done 8 total at a super honest price 20 € per massage  VOTE 10  Holiday just to remember for all these exceptional things, the only drawback that could improve to get to perfection, the kitchen quite repetitive in fourteen days with a few dishes to my taste good, you saved the first of the Italian chef made at the time and little else.

This hotel truly feels on brand with other Marriott hotels around the world. It is tastefully decorated. We were warmly greeted by the front service desk staff. I had let the hotel know in advance that it was my husband's birthday, and they went above and beyond to surprise us with a room that was fully decorated with balloons and a delicious cake. The room is spacious, and has plenty of storage space. The gym on the upper level beautifully overlooks the Tunis skyline and has one multi-purpose / multi-functional machine, free weights, and few treadmills, elliptical and stationary bicycle. We tried both the L'Onzième Grill and Lounge; the food and service was amazing. There was even a great house music DJ playing that night. The hotel is conveniently located less than 10 minutes from the airport. If you are looking to sight-see, then it is a bit further away from the Medina and Downtown Tunis. The area around this hotel is predominantly business and commercial. Overall, this hotel is a great choice if you need to be close to the airport."

        "review_text": "As a Titanium Bonvoy member, my request for a quiet room was completely ignored.  I arrived after 23:00 to check in and was placed in a 6th floor room facing the busy highway.  Vehicle noise made it so I didn't get much sleep the first night.  Also, there was a welcome plate of sweets and a note, but the note was addressed to someone, and not me.    The next day I requested they move me to the other side of the building, and they put me in a quiet room on the 9th floor, which was much better and I was able to sleep peacefully the last four nights of my stay.  Free breakfast in the restaurant was a nice benefit for Titanium members.  There were a variety of tasty Tunisian dishes.  The gym had new equipment and was good.  The M Lounge was nice, with great attendants at happy hour who are happy to bring you wine or beer.  The daytime front desk staff were friendly and helpful.    I would have rated this hotel 5 stars if they hadn't ignored my request and put me in a noisy room my first night, causing me to not get much sleep and to be extremely tired the next day."

        "review_text": "Being a Lifetime Titanium member with over 2200 nights at Marriott properties, we really were looking forward to a 5 night stay at this property but unfortunately we were very disappointed.  From the chaotic breakfast dining every morning to the lack of service in the concierge lounge and lastly while the room was nice, there were 3 days out of 5 where the only water available was hot water and no cold water while trying to shower.  Let's start with the breakfast.  We had breakfast for 5 mornings so this was not an isolated incident.  It was chaotic.  Frequently, they ran out of cups for coffee and hot tea.  The staff could not keep up with cleaning the tables when it was crowded.  Staff would walk around aimlessly or stand in the corner talking to one another.  I use cleaning loosely because I seldom saw people wiping down the tables after someone left.  Tables would be in various states when we arrived, sometimes a fork was missing or a knife or a glass.  There is a juice station but good luck trying find someone to make you fresh juice.  The door was sometimes left open and then you were surrounded by flies.  Most mornings I would just watch and observe the chaos of the staff walking around trying to keep up with the people coming thru.  It isn't rocket science - you go to a vacated table, put all the dirty items on a tray, wipe the table, come back to the table with the clean items.  The Concierge Lounge - we came here for 5 nights.  Every night it was pretty much the same hot item - dry chicken.  You can get beer and wine but not on your own.  They don't keep the beer opener out in the open.  However, good luck with trying to find someone to open it for you.  Expect a long wait.  One night, we came in, sat down at a table and people would see us and walk back and forth.  Back and forth, including 2 guys in suits (assuming manager) and seeing us at a table without any drinks, didn't ask - can I get you something?  Nope.  Just sitting there waiting for you to serve me a drink.  We ordered a pizza to be delivered to the lounge, fully expecting to pay for it.  Manager comes over and says, we are getting you the pizza.  Sure, seemed weird.  Pizza comes, they put it in the common area for everyone.  I said, we ordered that pizza.  They said yes, you don't need to pay for it.  OK so can I have the whole thing?  The Room - while the room itself was nice, 3 days out of 5, the only water that came out was hot, including the shower.  So when shower, expect 3rd degree burns.  I called and talked to the front desk - had MULTIPLE discussions.  They said they would send someone up the 1st time.  No one came.  Water was fine after a period of time.  Next day, I walked down to the Front Desk so I could speak with a person.  I said, is this happening in other rooms because I was willing to move.  No answer, I assume that person did not know.  They said they would send someone up.  That person came after an hour and it was no longer an issue.  I asked if this is happening in all the rooms, he responded he didn't speak much english.  I sent all of this information to Marriott and what did they do?  Give me 15,000 measly points.  I'm not sure if there is a better alternative to stay, it is Tunis after all but most likely I will not be returning to the hotel."

Unfortunately, the hotel has charged us an incredible €45 – five times! This is absolutely unjustified and a clear rip-off for us. There was no response at all to our request to adjust the booking accordingly or at least to find a fair solution.  Unfortunately, the hotel also leaves much to be desired: Cleanliness was poor, especially the pool – sandy and unkempt. Overall very disappointing. For us this was the first and last stay."

Since the presence of this service was known on the hotel's website, we asked the receptionist who was very annoyed but indicated where the pool was. Arrived in front of the entrance we found it closed with a deadbolt despite being fully functional. We asked for clarification and we were not given any answer except that of an orderly who tried to call the attendants to activate the service but received no answer. The receptionist didn't give a damn and let us know not to insist. If you like indoor pools don't go."

First guy at check in was completely unhelpful giving instructions and info on hotel and town. Then we asked for one shampoo and had to wait about 45 mins to then get a shower gel instead. Eventually at breakfast the waiter was EXTREMELY RUDE and made us feel very uncomfortable. We wanted to finish our sandwich in the car as the driver arrived and in front of other hotel guests sitting in the restaurant he screamed at us treating us like criminal and forcing us to sit down to finish it. In my entire life I’ve never experience such an uncomfortable situation and nobody has ever spoken to me like this. We were two young girls on a visit in Tunis and the fact that a man shouted in this was chasing us to the door entrance is something I really do not want to experience anymore. So if you are a group of girls traveling you might want to think twice before booking because there is a VERY STRONG misogynist component here.  Only the lady at the reception was able to understand us and offered later on a snack box but this does not excuse the lack of respect. Thankfully we only stayed one night."

The blankets were dirty with spots on them still with some crusts. the drawers were broken, the french window doors were not closing properly and extremely. the curtains were not hung properly. one of the bedside lamps was not working same for the room lobby light. No phone service in the rooms (the telephone was there, all sticky but no tonality) the tv was not working (a small broken box was there with half of the buttons missing, and no single channel is there, let alone a remote)I can go on and on and on. And i swear i'm not exaggerating. One and only thing positive i could say about this hotel is how nice and helpful the reception people and all the hotel employees were and that I guess is true for all tunisian people in general. Internet wifi was free in the lobby area so at least that was there. I went through all the reviews and I was extremely surprised how people cld like this hotel, seriously !!! i was even angry coz i relied on those same reviews to accept such a transit hotel by tunisair. So either this hotel has reallly deteriorated since their reviews or its only lies or maybe we are speaking about a different hotel, coz the one and only el oumara at rue ali darghouth looks like to be an abandonned property. Please people be objective and honest in your reviews other are relying on them."

Beautiful nature around the hotel, great swimming pool, beautiful beach and sea just few steps from the hotel.  But the best part are the people in there! I felt very safe. They were smiling all the time to begin with reception manager and cleaning ladies. I've never met so many nice people! Animators were great, so positive and so kind ♥️ There was activities like aqua gym, archery, darts, volleyball, dancing, show every evening and many other. You don't have to leave a hotel because there was also few shops in there. I agree with others that this is 3* hotel, for sure not 4. It needs good renovation. But it is spacious, clean and I saw that whole staff was doing their best. My special thanks to Animators: Miro- the sweetest young man I've ever met, Amine who motivated me to go start to work out again, Mario- best dancer 🫶 and Kimo, Tigana, Youssef, Tchitchou ❤️❤️❤️ Big THANKS to bartender Blaid Ayadi- very kind and good person ♥️ I'll go back there for sure just for this people and the atmosphere! 😊😊😊"

The staff was not really attentive, I felt quite…anonymous, if you know what I mean.  I had an impression French people were having the most attention and care from staff. During my 5 days stay there was at least one time when I went to a dinner and I could not find a place to sit, I was walking around with my plates and no one cared about this, even if the waiters saw me looking for a table.  Food was okay for me, most of it was quite tasty, I was not hungry. But margarine instead of butter... I’d expect more.  The real highlight of my day was melon served during lunch time - it was the best melon I’ve ate ever.  Room was okay, furniture could be newer, everything could be cleaner. But it wasn’t the worst.  The beach was nice but I feel like it was dirty, I’m not sure what was that but I think there was w lot of camel poop in the sand. Sunbeds should be changed for sure.  AC was working but it was not the strongest.  All in all, I’d like to come back to Tunisia but for sure I’d look for a better hotel."

Breakfast was ordinary to say the least- like a low budget hotel. I pitied the people with all inclusive meals.  I had one beer - it was flat! Paid wifi??  40 euro for a week - Seriously that deal died years ago.   The pool and the location were nice - the saving grace"

        "review_text": "For my part, I don't understand the disastrous reviews with a Rating of 1/5 \"to run away\" that scared me before Check-out... We had a great family holiday and it would be quite possible that we would return to this Inn in the future!  First, you must remain objective you are in Tunisia not in France! A 4-star there is not a 4-star with us. Then you are on an all inclusive buffet at a reasonable Award so you necessarily have quite simple dishes.  However starting from these two points we enjoyed our meals, the buffet offers a lot of choices and almost homemade. The only downside comes not from the buffet or the staff but from tourists who take incredible amounts to make a lot of mess and who often cut the queue in front of those who wait.. Review for us: Inn clean, appreciable meal with superb surroundings, sea and pool view room, very spacious pool, friendly staff, lots of friendly meetings on and off site. I recommend the small shop of Mohamed and Sami both extremely honest and always available for a nice discussion purchase or not.  Leaving the Inn take the sidewalk in front and on the right \"the Mediterranean\" on google = Center of natural Tunisian Spices and \"Tunisian Crafts\". Of course, our review is up to us, it is obvious that everyone's feelings are not the same in our experience and expectations, as can be seen clearly from previous reviews. Nevertheless I take the time to write this review because for us this Inn certainly does not deserve the mention \"to flee\" and we hope it will reassure other people who may have been afraid to read some reviews like this may have been our case."

        "review_text": "This hotel is fantastic with lots of amazing staff who can’t do enough for you and I know you read that on lots of hotels but here it’s actually true and the hotel is not giant so you are not just another face in the crowd like most large 5 star hotels Iv stayed at, here it’s like Cheers everyone remembers your name from all the staff to people you meet, it’s great. The food in the main restaurant has a wide and It is a wide variety to choose from so everyone no matter what you are you can eat here and the beach snack bar/ restaurant you can book your a la carte or just have a delicious burger.  I must mention the staff on the beach who keep it clean and tidy for you and really can’t do enough for you like Tasnime who is a security guard on the beach but I watched him run into the sea and save a teenage boy who got into trouble and he got to the boy just as the boys head went under the water and as he got to the area the boys head went down he dived under the water for a few seconds and brought the boy back to the surface! Wow I witnessed a hero at work that day and I hope the hotel congratulated Tasnime on his heroic actions when the life guard was at the toilet and I’m not faulting the lifeguard because we all need to go and the beach was safe but as you know it only takes one second for things to go wrong so maybe they should have two lifeguards on the beach. Apart from that It was amazing to witness. 👏 So the staff will literally save your life if needed.  The Animation team like Gigi, Simo and Duda to mention just a few who entertain everyone around the pool from 9am until 11pm it’s a very long day for them doing what they do and I don’t think they get the credit they deserve for all the fantastic work they do. I must mention the fantastic housekeeping staff because they do such fantastic work cleaning your room on a daily basis and the lady who cleaned my room was a lovely lady who always greeted us with a smile saying hello and always left flowers on our bed. I spent 2 weeks there in May 2025 and Iv just book again to go back in October this year and I’m going to book 3 weeks next year. It really is that good and I’m a well traveled man of 51 years of age who has been on every continent on the planet. Book this hotel you will not regret it."

        "review_text": "Our second visit to this wonderful hotel in two years, we were still impressed by all of the staff from the gardener up to the Manager, many who remembered us from last year.  There has been one or two changes which in our mind has spoilt the bar area, it is now like a sports bar, fine if you want to watch football 24/7.  The rooms are a little bit tired but are cleaned with the towels being replaced as necessary. The beds are comfortable but oh dear the  pillows ..... very lumpy they need replacing. The shower, which is very powerful, is over the bath which in itself isn't a problem but would be better off with walk in showers.  The dining room is very good because you are allocated a table which you keep for all of your stay, saves having to search for one.   The food wasn't as good as last year, not as much variety for the main course, lots of chicken (over cooked and dry), the meats were not carved just pulled apart and put on your plate.   Fresh fruit not as plentiful as last year.  In our mind the best meal of the day was breakfast, plenty of variety and omelettes to die for, cooked to perfection.  Waiting staff are very good no complaints at all.  Pool area always kept clean and there always seemed to be sun beds available even after people had put their towels out early.  The beach area is fantastic, with life guards and security in attendance, the security guard will take your towels and find you a sun bed.  The beach bar is a nice touch where you are served by friendly staff, nothing too much trouble for anyone.  Having mentioned the food quality it wouldn't stop us from revisiting as this is a first class hotel."

        "review_text": "We had a very nice two weeks at Royal Nozha. First of all, I would like to mention that the staff are very cordial. We felt very welcome and they were always willing to help.   The atmosphere in the hotel is pleasant, it is a bit smaller which we like. The beach is beautiful, the rooms clean and we found the beach bar and the beach the nicest part to be.   If you like excursions or outings, there are several things to do such as an overnight stay or camel ride in the Sahara, visiting the medina of Hammamet, quad biking, boat trips etc.  We came to chill out so mainly did our own thing, but if you do like entertainment at the hotel there is the fun animation team from Mido who are always committed to making you feel at home. They make daily contact with the visitors making people feel like family of the hotel.   The food was good and varied enough, the service and cooks at the restaurant were very friendly and genuinely happy to see and greet you every time.  Of course there are always some aging and downsides to be found if you start paying attention to that, but we found it a very nice place. I have been to Tunisia before, and this hotel surpasses it in terms of experience. The hardworking, lovely and cordial people who work in this hotel make it an even better place than it already is in my opinion.  Thanks again for that!  Love from Marinka and Amber"

        "review_text": "This was the best holiday I have ever been on!   Me and my partner have just retuned after a 1 week stay at the royal nozha hotel in hammamet. We had the most amazing time.   All of the staff are super friendly and very helpful. We felt at home from the moment we arrived at the hotel to the second we left - we didn’t want to leave!   I’d like to give a special shout out to mido and his animation team for making our holiday experience so enjoyable, they ran activities throughout the day including: darts, bowls, table tennis and water sports  and had great shows and entertainment in the evening for all ages! They are the best team of people and made sure we always had something to do and were always checking in on us.   The food was very good, and the restaurant was a nice calm atmosphere, it was a buffet and had lots of choices for breakfast lunch and  dinner (I am a picky eater and there was always plenty options for me)   The a la carte meal which on coco beach (part of the hotel) was delicious - I have added a photo of the menu for this!   The rooms are clean and spacious too! We didn’t have any complaints - we went as a couple and had a gobble bed as well as 2 single beds in the room with a nice balcony.   Nothing is too much trouble for any of the staff!   There is a bowling alley down the stairs from the hotel - this does cost extra to use as it’s not affiliated with the hotel but it is very cheap! Ans a lot of fun - the animation tam held a bowling competition there on Tuesday and all the holiday makers had a blast!   Amazing hotel 1000/10 me and my partner have already booked to go back next year!"

The hotel is clean, the staff are amazing, the rooms are comfortable and the quality of the food was far, far better than expected. My wife is coeliac and was well catered for but you can’t get gluten free bread in Tunisia so take some with you if possible. Sure, there were some nights I didn’t fancy most of the food on offer but I always found something good to eat. The pizzas are amazing. Our main waiter, Faycal (Faisal), was exceptional. The facilities are well run and amenable - Bars, pool etc…. The entertainment team are also great, not pushy and like a bit of light hearted fun. The staff in the main bar, brilliant and funny. They say you get what you pay for. With this hotel you get MORE than you pay for. So many guests have stayed here on multiple occasions and I can understand why. Ignore any negative reviews, as this hotel is brilliant. My wife and I travel regularly and this is one of the few hotels that we would seriously consider revisiting."

Staff are amazing especially the animation team that go above and beyond to make you welcome and entertained without any much pressure. Food is generally typically all inclusive but the desserts are fantastic. They are really trying to upgrade the hotel this year and its just made it better there. My only thing is the night reception guy. Never gives you the correct exchange for your money and doesn’t issue a receipt. It wasnt a one off as he did it last year as well. The day reception guy is so helpful and genuinely lovely. There are too many staff that are fantastic to name individually. But the cleaner for room 3045 was amazing and all the little towel animals and flowers she left in our room made our stay extra special. Hopefully see you next year xx"

We were 3 friends visiting and we were disappointed with our room, so a quick visit to reception and the brilliant manager moved us to a pool view room at no extra charge. Brilliant service. You are allocated a table for the duration of your visit which is great and saves time searching for an empty table, your waiter will get to know what you like to drink and bring it over. I needed soya milk in the mornings and this was quickly arranged and then bought to me daily. Thank you. Security on the beach was great, it just stopped the sellers coming up to you, police patrol on quad bikes as well. The whole beach area from the bar, cocco beach are kept spotless. I recommend the pizzas, made to your request.. we didn’t really partake in the entertainment, choosing to sit in the bar talking. The only downside for us were the drinks. The cocktails were weak. Great if you drink wine, beer, gin and vodka, but it did not spoil the holiday.  We got a taxi to the market. 20 Dinar each way and worth a visit. Remember to barter as they like you to.  A tip. Change your Dinar BEFORE you go through security as we thought we could spend ours in duty free but had ours confiscated.  I would recommend this hotel and would visit again. Well done to all the staff"

        "review_title": "As Robinson experts... Djerba surprised us a lot!",
        "review_text": "For a long time we have visited two Robinson clubs every year. We feel very comfortable there... and our son much more. Our club, our home is the Robinson Esquinzo. We also liked other clubs like Pamfylia very much... and others – although also good (some we have even visited repeatedly) – are not quite as excellent... like Cala Serena.  This year, after our visit to Esquinzo for Carnival, we went to Djerba Bahiya for Easter... and from the first moment we realized how special this club is. It is very compact, which means that you can reach everything quickly and easily.  Let's start with the only point that could be improved: For a club with a lot of sports and a lot of guests washing their clothes, the washers and dryers should be industrial – like Cala Serena (or formerly Esquinzo – that should be improved there too). The duration of a wash cycle with normal machines is too long, and the three dryers stopped working just 13 days after the start of the season.  Positive? Everything else. Rooms are spacious and functional. The mattresses very comfortable and the sleep quality excellent. Café Maure is one of our favourite places to have an Arabic coffee (as good as Damascus or Aleppo) or a “thé à la menthe”. Very quiet... and especially beautiful on days with music. The pool is pleasant for a swim... but actually we used to swim on the beach every day – 400 meters south of the hotel. Wonderful water temperature. Speaking of sea: Mahoui (who we knew from Esquinzo) and his team are doing a great job. WellFit and the sauna are also top (Vady and Tomas are the sauna masters... but also Yannick did a very good job in one day). Fantastic work by Pepi – very professional and motivating. Anna leads the entire team with great competence.  At the pool bar, all staff are very attentive and friendly – they know what you like to drink after a short time. Even the evening parties at the pool bar are very atmospheric. The tennis courts are in very good condition. And they are made of sand – perfect for my knees. Our son participated in the tennis camp at Mirko, which was also of very high quality.  Dining room/restaurant: We really liked that the chef was present at the dinners – very friendly. The quality of the food was excellent, especially the variety of dishes served. In the dining room, one person made us especially happy – on the terrace, to the right of the entrance: Waiter Cupid. Excellent and very friendly.  And finally, the most important thing for us: Especially this year, when the Robs at the Esquinzo was not in his best shape in March, we would like to highlight the Robs in Djerba. A Robs group lives off the work of its leaders, and in this case Malin and Gianna did an excellent job. Our son was happy. The two of them got involved. Our son told us they were part of the group. Congratulations, Mahmud, for having such professional, friendly, sympathetic and dedicated staff as Malin and Gianna.  Clearly: Djerba Bahija is part of our Robinson Club podium. We will come back!"

        "review_text": "I spent a wonderful time at Robinson Djerba Bahia - it was perfect all around. The complex is very nice and clear, located on a wide sandy beach - ideal also for families with children. Special praise goes to the entire team on site. They are all in a great mood and highly motivated. The positive energy is really contagious. I would particularly like to highlight the guest relations Pauli, Steffi and Veronika, who really live their job and try to read the wishes from the lips of all guests. The food is very good to sensational - always fresh and varied. There is something for every taste. Very good also the barbecue in the beach restaurant (for a fee) a very special atmosphere. My highlight of the sundowner at Café Maure. Cool live music with delicious cocktails and nice conversations. The evening shows are on a high level and you can feel with how much passion and commitment the participants represent them. Compliment! As a repeat offender, all I can say is: I will definitely be back!!!"

        "review_text": "We are currently spending an absolute dream holiday at Robinson Djerba Bahia that exceeds our expectations in every respect. And as long-time Robinson vacationers, they are naturally very high. Since this is the most cost-effective club by the sea, we thought we might have to cut corners. All the more astonished we were that in many places we even see the club in front of others. Here the very special Robinson spirit still reigns (or again?).   Even our arrival was as we only know it “from before” and what Robinson always stood for. As soon as our (very old) taxi pulled up, several employees came laughing to greet us with a flag-waving and soft drink (with fresh mint and lemon). We briefly thought that two suitcases were missing and possibly had stopped at the airport. Thanks to the nimble staff, they were already standing in the pretty, typical hotel lobby in bright cream colours. You have to smile unconsciously when you enter them. Maybe it's also because you're lit up from all sides by the employees. At the reception everything was perfectly prepared. The check-in was relaxed and cheerful: Our room cards were already ready and the rooms (although just 12 o'clock at noon) were ready to move into. Speaking of rooms: we had read a lot about these before, but little good. All the bigger our surprise when we entered this (family room superior - two double rooms with connecting door with sea view). Everything bright, clean, new furniture, freshly painted. A handwritten greeting card from club boss Mahmut (thank you!). And then this incredible view outside. Sea “view” is almost an understatement. Because you don't just see it. It is literally tangible. The rooms are located directly on the white sandy beach. To wake up in the morning and immediately see the turquoise water: priceless.  Reaction from home to our first photos: “Wow! Are you in the Maldives? This is supported by the beautiful colour scheme throughout the club: white-blue or white-turquoise. The beach restaurant, the beach bar, the daybeds all look bright blue, Caribbean and welcoming here. And from all these places you are as close to the sea as we have ever experienced before. This is also great at lunchtime, when you enjoy your lunch in the beach restaurant and the waves reach almost to this one. Regardless of the fresh fish, the great salads and grilled dishes, every lunch will be a highlight.   In general, we found the food great. Rarely have we seen such elaborately decorated buffets at Robinson's. From breakfast to dinner: art objects “carved” from melons and pineapple, herbal ornaments, tomato-cucumber creations, carrot-zucchini flowers. A true feast for the eyes and palate. Breakfast is one of the best we've had at Robinson's so far, in our opinion. The table wine in white and rosé are really good to drink (which is not the case in all clubs). And we enjoy amazing Tunisian red wines from the wine list in the evening thanks to the great advice (including from Habib). Yesterday’s gala dinner was as much a culinary highlight for us as the gourmet menu in the specialty restaurant on Wednesday evening, when the great four-person team around Ahmid took care of the guests in a very special way. He asked us for our names and now always addresses us with them as soon as we meet him at the club. Overall, we are pampered and looked after by everyone in all restaurants and at every meal. That may sound exaggerated. But it actually feels like being a guest here is very special. The level (professionalism, friendliness, language skills, commitment, attention) of the employees is really remarkably high.   That is certainly also because Mahmut himself, as club boss, is exemplary every minute. We knew and liked him very much in Robinson Fleesensee. He learned Robinson «from the ground up», his talent was aptly recognised and promoted by the Robinson's own leadership programme. Our impression: This approach simply produces the best club bosses. Because they live the spirit of Robinson, know the quite special needs of Robsinson guests and at the same time understand those of employees at all levels. You used to be a bar employee or sports entertainer yourself, know what it means to be in the restaurant or on the show stage after a long day at work and what it takes to motivate each other in a team, yet still give everything. Here on Djerba Mahmut seems to be even more in his element than in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Well, who can blame him? ;-) (no offense Fleesensee, we've been there over 30 times, but as I write this I'm looking at the beautiful sea, a cloudless sky, two camels and a mile-long white sand beach...). What Mahmut created here, how he built a young, dedicated team, is impressive. He shines, is always present, inspires guests and motivates employees. Great to watch as he gathers his department heads in a circle around him in the morning and addresses them. You can see them listening to him, respecting him and being proud to be part of this fantastic team.   Guests notice and celebrate. Standing at the bar, at the chessboard and when they applaud incredibly good dance shows in the theatre, after which the employees happily congratulate each other afterwards and lie in each other's arms. There is no question: there is a great atmosphere in this team. And that then also rubs off on the mood of the guests. If even we celebrate until midnight after the mega gala show, at the chessboard with brilliant live music (which is fortunately often found here!), then this testifies to the fact that both the atmosphere at the atmospherically lit pool and bar area, as well as the conversations with other exciting guests and nice employees, inspire us and make us forget time.   Because actually we are morning people, which you will find mainly in the many sports courses. What Anna has already set up at the start of the season as a Wellfit department manager is just as great as her dance performance with the great Thomas on stage Thursday night. Also the courses at Yannis and Heidi were absolutely top. Heidi is here right now as one of many external so-called experts, and she actually deserves the name, both in terms of her own fitness, expertise and her enthusiastic way of running classes.  We also have nothing against temporary offers, as there are some in the club right now (for example for creative crafts for children). These also bring variety and inspiration to a team and enable many and varied courses to be offered, especially during peak times.   Last but not least, I would like to mention something Mahmut emphasized in his small, moving speech after the gala show: many thanks to all the more than 400 employees - even to those you don't see as a guest so often: the gardeners, chefs, dishwashers, technicians, craftsmen, securities, beach chair pad bringers (always mega-nimble and so nice!) and of course maids (we had the very, very best!).   Shukran lak, sawf naeud. Thank you, dear ones, we will be back!"

The club offers first-class service, a dedicated and highly trained team and a diverse gastronomic offer. Whether vegans, vegetarians or meat lovers – everyone will find something delicious here. Every day new culinary highlights await guests, prepared with great love and creativity.  The sports and entertainment programme is versatile and leaves nothing to be desired: Whether body workout, Zumba, stretch & relax, yoga, fitness, boxing, cycling, tennis, beach volleyball, football, archery, golf or water sports – there is something for everyone. The courses are led by professional and motivated trainers so that both beginners and advanced students are supervised.  Another highlight is of course the sea – turquoise blue, clean and simply fantastically beautiful. On some days, the water may be a little murkier; then water shoes are recommended. If you like, you can walk a bit to the left or right along the beach and be rewarded with a Caribbean-like bathing paradise.  Our stay was relaxed from start to finish and completely successful. The Robinson Djerba Bahiya exceeded our expectations – we can fully recommend it and are already looking forward to our next visit!"

All chairs are equipped with plastic cushions that stick to the butt and mostly high chairs. - The drinks, including wines, are all terrible. - The shows are fine, but we've seen much better at other Robinson clubs. Luhana was especially weak. - The Hawaiian evening meal had nothing to do with Hawaii. - The mattresses were quite hard. - The archery field is not usable in summer. There are hardly any shadows."

        "review_text": "Very nice Pension, excellent catering with a large selection of well cooked and presented dishes. All sorts of sports and outing Things to do, there is something for everyone. The rooms are minimalist, no storage drawers, no decoration and tristounet furniture. On arrival the receptionist did not speak a word of French, she was German and the exchange was therefore made in English... I had booked a sea view room, but the one we were assigned overlooked the inside of the blocks. At the reception I was informed that they had not had the information from the tour operator... Another receptionist (who spoke to him French...) found us a room with sea view, but as the Pension was supposedly complete, we were on the ground floor, in a family room which was certainly larger, but whose sound insulation leaves to be desired. We could hear our neighbors when they were in their bathroom, as if they were in our own room!! Nevertheless the facilities whether beach or pool are up to the standard, I recommend the beach restaurant and the beach bar (special mention for Mabruk, efficient and friendly waiter). The only really negative point was the 99% German customer base, if we had known that we would not have chosen this Pension. We have been to Djerba several times and generally the clientele is cosmopolitan, but this club is not to be recommended to the French, some German clients do not seem to appreciate our presence and make no effort to speak, even in English. Even the manager, German, did not seek to discuss with me in English. Fortunately the Tunisian staff were happy to speak to us in French! The very few French or Belgian speakers we met felt the same way and told us that they would not come back either, despite the quality of the Pension. I submit this review so that tour operators selling stays at this Pension mention that it is a German club for German family customers."

The food is always buffet, although almost everything is rather tasteless. At 7:20 p.m., everyone storms into the dining area and secures the tables. If you arrive at 7:30 p.m. on time, you won't find room. When we decided to book wine and dine places, we were presented with the wine list. Consistently Tunisian wines for 30-50€. All were created from the vinegar category. This situation is intolerable! Every evening the party music resounds from the bar into the rooms. Sleep is unthinkable until 1 a.m. The whole thing then culminates in the arrogance of the reception, who doesn't care.  What was outstanding: the Nautic School for sailing and childcare, where Ellen and Anne are to be mentioned. At Letizia's and others' house, my child wanted to be picked up. Employees generally only move against regular tips. Robinson really needs to think about whether they want to keep this club going. Apart from the Roby Club and the sailing school, the whole hotel needs a new coat of paint and a change of management. In no case is this club worth a Recommendation"

Cleanliness is the most important thing for us and we were never disappointed. Even the delicious and varied food has always pleased the children and us. There are always Things to do for young and old But you can also take it easy and just chill. In short, Robinson Club Djerba Bahiya has the ideal conditions for an unforgettable holiday. Thanks for everything and hopefully see you next year!"

        "review_text": "We have been avid Robinson travelers for many years and were as a family with our 15-year-old son in August 2024 on a summer vacation in Djerba Bahiya.   We noticed that there was no usual \"coming home\" at this club. I.e. it took us longer at this club to arrive and arrive. Until the end, we missed the classic Robinson charm. Whether we will go to this club again, we do not know today.  But there were also many POSITIVES: But what we can say: As always, we met great people and enjoyed special moments.   What you really have to give the club is the varied sports offer with really TOP coaches.  A special thanks goes to:   Tennis coach \"Emmy\" -> Always in a good mood, top organized + attentive and courteous. If you want to make progress in tennis, you must book a coaching lesson with her. Or 2 or 3 :-). Emmy is a coach with a passion for this sport.  Water sports coach \"Mirja\": Daily changing program with a changing music playlist and a lot of good mood + motivation. It has been clearly noticed that Mirja gives qualified lessons and has a lot of experience in this area. And best of all: All exercises were also feasible and effective in the water. Highlight was aqua jogging in the sea. One of those Robinson moments :-)  Mindfulness trainer \"Janin Stötzner\": A special experience for the mindset, your own attitude... A coach with experience and a lot of sensitivity and an incredible charisma. Thank you for this experience that even our 15 year old son loved.  And what stands out very positively are the very striving and courteous staff in the service + the small, beautifully assorted Robinson shop with a great special offer. Worth a visit!"

        "review_text": "“A stay ruined by poor security management”  I am a loyal guest of the Robinson Bahia Pension in Jerba, where I visit every year for a three-week stay. Until now, I have always been satisfied with the establishment. The Pension offers a pleasant setting with all the necessary amenities, a quality restaurant and a wide range of Things to do for every taste.  However, this year my experience was quite different. Victim of its success, the Pension was fuller than usual, and unfortunately I noticed a number of incivilities from other guests. I even had the unpleasant surprise of having my flip-flops stolen by another customer. The absence of surveillance cameras did not confirm the facts and, despite my efforts to report the incident, the Pension staff were not very helpful.  But the most regrettable was an event at the very end of the stay. A friend of my daughter’s entered the Pension 5 minutes to charge her phone, which triggered a disproportionate reaction from security and especially supervisor Karim.Not only was the police called for a case I didn’t even understand, but I was barred from my own room and my daughter’s room by disabling our keys. All this while I had paid my 21-day stay at the highest rate. My daughter’s friend had to pay 200 dinars for allegedly consuming something, a situation as absurd as it is unfair.  I find this particularly regrettable as I have always enjoyed this Inn, but this last experience completely changed my point of view. Despite my many years of loyalty, I will not go back. I will now spend my €5000 on other establishments, where incident management is hopefully more appropriate and respectful of customers.  Too bad it ended this way."

        "review_text": "We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful dar in the heart of the medina. Indeed, I cannot imagine that you will find better lodging in Tunis. I've stayed in many places in many countries, and this is among the very best.  Room: I believe there are four rooms altogether, one of which is an apartment. We made a point of reserving the blue room well in advance, and were glad we did. Gorgeously appointed and embarrassingly spacious, we felt like royalty. The bed was firm (which I prefer) and very comfortable. The shower is small but adequate, and the water pressure and temperature were excellent. There were plenty of electrical outlets. The room was well insulated from noise overall, although, it being spring, at times one could hear the sounds of cats wooing in the alley below.  Location: Perfect for exploring the medina, with several cafés and sandwich stalls nearby. Personally, I would strongly recommend staying in the medina, which is atmospheric and surprisingly peaceful. Though it was pretty easy to locate via GPS, we were glad we booked our taxi through the B & B, as the medina is a bit of a maze and most drivers won't take your directly to the door.  Staff: The owner, his wife and the staff were unfailingly cheerful and friendly. I texted the owner several times with questions, and his responses were prompt and helpful. My wife developed a medical problem, and he was kind enough to arrange to have a doctor/acupuncturist come to our room. Thank you, Marouane.  Food: Breakfasts were spectacular, with different options every day, most of them homemade. We were given access to bottled water as needed, and were able to buy glasses of wine."

Very cool domed ceiling with groovy chandelier Lovely bathroom, ample linens, tons of blazing hot water and great water pressure.

The husband and wife hosts and the two ladies who work with them are all completely lovely, attentive and helpful. Great location inside the car free medina. I cannot say enough good things about our stay and would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you!"

        "review_text": "I recently spent 3 nights at La Chambre Bleue. A charming guesthouse in the heart of Tunis medina.  The owner Marouane arranged a taxi for me and the driver brought me to the door. You'd struggle to find it alone.  My room was one of those pictured with an arched ceiling. Very pleasant and atmospheric. Complete with it's own patio. Note that the bottle of water provided is from the tap and whilst it won't kill you, I wouldn't have drank it had I known in advance.  Communication in advance was excellent. Marouane speaks excellent English and was quick to respond. So I was surprised on arrival to be greeted by a woman who did not speak a word. Marouane does not live there. This was not a big problem but if you speak zero French then you might not be entirely comfortable. But then if you speak zero French then you're going to struggle to travel independently in Tunisia. M was almost always available on whatsapp and came and had breakfast with me on the first and last mornings.  The house is super charming. He's refurbished it and wants to have cultural events there. Breakfast was varied with traditional type items. I would perhaps have preferred eggs, cream cheese etc (which I got other places). The lady running the place was very nice, despite the language barrier we got by on a combination of my bad French and google translate.  It's worth noting that food options in the medina are a bit limited, and they close pretty early. I survived on the snacks I'd brought with me on the first night as everything was closed. It was only around 6pm. Even worse on Sundays. It's not the most tourist friendly medina (thinking of Marrakech, for example). Make sure and save the location of the guesthouse on google maps. When the shops close and the lights go out you might struggle to find your way home.  La Chambre Bleue is undoubtedly a top choice for your stay in Tunis medina."

        "review_text": "We were fortunate that when we contacted Sondos that she had the Makhazen room (with the cross-vault soaring ceilings and a column) available.  The room has a private courtyard and is very spacious.  The bathroom is quirky (no door) but functional.  The walk-in shower is a small alcove but as there is no shower door or screen it does not feel cramped (nor did the bathroom get wet!).  Breakfast is served upstairs in the dining room.  There were significant changes every day but constant were an outstanding juice (prune, peach and banana), yoghurt, black bread toast, ricotta and a large array of jams and honey plus coffee/tea.  The girl service breakfast and making our room was so delightful!  Breakfast was served from 08:30 and we never had any appetite for lunch afterwards!  Sondos arranged an airport pick-up for us which was nice as La Chambre Bleu is located in the Medina.  However, the Medina is compact and we never had any issues finding our around.  Be aware that the shops close early 17:00-17:30: then the souks and the Medina are dark - phone flashlights are useful as rubbish goes into the centre of the ‘street’ for removal but is likely still there when you are walking back to your room at night.  We never heard any external noise when we were in the room which made for excellent rest.  Sondos provides us with a great map of the Medina with restaurants, cafes, and sights to visit which simplified getting around.  A fabulous base in a wonderful, underrated city/country.  Highly recommend."

        "review_text": "La Chambre bleue is an absolutely wonderful bed and breakfast in the heart of the Medina of Tunis. Sondos, the gracious Hostess, makes you feel right at home in every way possible. She really goes the extra mile. Incredibly friendly, patient, and multilingual, she will give you one of the best breakfasts is you'll have in your life!  Does anyone else love home made jam?    Not only that, but she will also give you an infinite amount of recommendations for Tunis as well as the rest of Tunisia. I actually had many questions for her during the day while out.  So, via WhatsApp, I asked her about many things many times. She always got back to me incredibly quickly!  Even after we had checked out, her response time was super quick whenever we had a question for her.    Also, the room itself was fantastic. Two of us stayed in her apartment, which to me resembled an ancient Roman villa. With a bit of Old World Arabic charm thrown in as well.    It was wintertime, and probably as cold as Tunis can get (surprising cold at night!). But the room was nice and toasty warm. I'm sure it would be nice and cool in the hot summer months as well. Plenty of hot water, and the tap water is even drinkable, (at least according to Sondos).  I drank it every day when I was there, and it tasted fine (plus I has no problems).    If you're Backpacker on a budget, but you want to Splash out on an experience where you really get your money's worth, I would recommend this one. You won't regret it.    And, if you have a bit of a higher budget, I can't imagine any amenity that you have in a hotel that you would not have at la chambre bleue. The breakfast, attentive service answering any questions, the Wi-Fi in the room was also fantastic, and the breakfast was amazing.  Plus, this is a renovated old house, and the atmosphere was great.  Almost like living in one of these beautiful museums!  Not a sterile \"Trying to be Trendy and Modern\" blah pretentious hotel.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention, she stored a bit of luggage for me while we were traveling around Tunis for a couple of weeks. Even though we didn't end up staying there on our way out of the country, she said it was no problem.   How great is this place!?!?    Thank you very much Sondos! You made our stay in Tunis exceptional, and I can't wait to go back and try out your other rooms!"

        "review_title": "A good stay overall",
        "review_text": "After reading all the positive TripAdvisor reviews, I decided to stay at La Chambre Bleue located in the Tunis Medina. My expectations were high and overall, the place did not disappoint.   After reading all the positive reviews , one might expect the place to blow your mind and knock your senses off completely - i.e create expectations of complete perfection.   My advice is to keep your expectations realistic when visiting this place and staying at La Chambre bleue. All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Tunis - La Chambre Bleue certainly did not disappoint but it was not spectacular either, as some other reviews may suggest. Hence , I am keeping this review as realistic and factual as possible.  The location of La Chambre bleue is spectacular - it is in the heart of the Tunis Medina - a vibrant place full of energy, color and character. At night , some of the bars and coffee places near the Dar El Jeld at the Kasbah liven up and offer great entertainment. Getting lost in the labyrinth of shops in the Medina and finding you way back to La Chambre bleue owned by Mrs Sondos Ben Miled is an experience in itself.   Everyone talked about the breakfast in the reviews. All items ( the main entree - either pancake with ricotta cheese or sweet couscous served along with bread and jam , fruits, yogurt , and coffee ) were fresh and well presented. In my opinion, items tend to be on the sweeter side , especially the main entree ( sweet couscous or the pancake with ricotta) and maybe it would be good to have something to neutralize this with a salty or savory item ( eggs, tofu or some other hot item) would be a good addition. Overall , breakfast was a good, family style experience. I enjoyed it.  Overall , the room itself - la Chambre bleue - was comfortable. I stayed for three nights and had a good nights sleep. As the other reviews state , there is character and uniqueness in the decor.   But please do not expect perfectness in the decor. If you do so, this is not the place for you. As an example, you will find broken tiles, unfinished decor, torn seats, torn carpets in some places both in the main room - la Chambre bleue - as well as the small adjoining room - sitting area. If you are a person who can see and appreciate the beauty by ignoring a few blemishes and wear and tear , you will be fine. After all , this is an old restored house that Mrs Sondos has been tying to restore.  During the time of my stay, the WiFi was spotty and did not work in the main room i.e. la Chambre bleue. I had to sit in the smaller adjoining room to get my work done. This issue with the Dlink router may have been fixed already now, hopefully.  During the time of my stay, there was a small leakage in the bathroom pipe because of which I was told to close it after usage.  This did not cause much of an issue or trouble to me. Hopefully, this is also addressed now. Bathroom tiles need to be added in one layer - was not a big issue. There were no issues with hot water during my stay.   You will see a small patio with lovely colorful furniture in some pictures. Note that this does not come as a part of the room - this is a private patio for Mrs Sondos and she would love to show it to you if you desire to view it.  Upon arriving , Mrs Sondos will welcome you and provide you a map with good details on suggested places to visit , eat etc. This is indeed helpful, as many reviewers have pointed out.   In my case, I followed Mrs Sondos’ advice , walked via the Medina to the new city and Habib  Bourghiba Avenue ,  took the TGM to Carthage and Sidi Bou Said. I got a bit lost on the first day as there were three train stations for the Carthage and I did not know where to get off. The next day , Sondos provided further clarity on which of the three stations to get off for visiting Punic Port, Antonian Baths etc. Personally, I enjoyed Sidi Bou Said the most - it was spectacular and much affordable than similar destinations in Greece like Santorini.  I also visited places like Gammarth , took a hamam at the Golden Tulip Carthage in Gammarth ( highly recommended)  , had dinner at Calcutta restaurant ( excellent Indian food.).  Overall , Mrs Sondos’ advice was helpful. She also advised me to visit the market at the entrance of the new city - this was an interesting place as well as I had never seen something like this before.   There is  a bottle of hot water provided and refilled during your stay. If tasted a bit strange - I would not recommend drinking it and would opt for sealed and bottled water instead - my humble opinion.  I booked my stay via hotels.com and paid 270 euros for a three night stay at la Chambre Bleue. Upon booking , I got a message from Mrs Sondos asking for my passport information so that she could “prepare for my stay”. I did not provide it initially as I was not comfortable providing these before my stay began - Sondos provided directions for the place, added me to WhatsApp and wrote an email saying that although she did not receive the passport details , she will collect them later. I subsequently provided the details before my stay began.   There is nothing fishy about this although it was a bit strange to me initially. While I understand that this is needed to provide to the authorities in Tunis and to provide a quick and convenient check in experience , for security and privacy reasons , I feel it is better to provide this information at the time of the stay rather than before your stay. This is of course my humble opinion and in accordance with standards in most hotels and airbnbs  I have stayed at.  Despite being vigilant on collecting passport details during check in, the only experience of my stay that was somewhat unpleasant was the check out experience - Mrs. Sondos forgot to ask me to pay cash upon checkout and I was under the impression that the payment was already made under the credit card that I submitted to Hotels.com upon booking.  Clearly , I should have been vigilant in asking Mrs Sondos if she got the money and Mrs Sondos should have asked me as well to pay.  This was an inconvenience for me as I had to arrange a bank wire transfer to Mrs Sondos after my stay and pay a fees to my bank for the same. Hence , instead of Euros 270, I paid euros 240 to Mrs Sondos and 30 euros for the bank transfer to my bank. I did not appreciate the dealings with Mrs Sondos in this situation - she got a bit panicky, mentioned that she need not “ support the charges”, wrongly stated that “ i forgot to pay” and asked me to “pay at least half”. Mrs. Sondos probably felt that I would not pay and completely misunderstood - which explains the panic situation. After I explained, I think she understood later and said that my responses were “ well received”.  Mrs Sondos’ reaction to the above situation may be one off. I feel she could have handled it better , especially with a guest who stayed at her house for three nights . Sadly, It all boiled down to money in the end. Situations such as the above tend to happen - what matters most is how you react to it and get out of it. According to her, all her guests pay cash upon checkout and they do not accept credit cards. As an improvement opportunity, this should be published in their website clearly.   All in all , I would still recommend staying at La Chambre Bleue if you are looking for an unique experience. Again , please do not expect perfection. From a value for money standpoint, improvement is needed in my humble opinion. Sondos is a hard working person and I found her usually very diligent and helpful in the three days that I knew her. If you can focus on the positive during your stay , you should be fine and will not be disappointed."

Our host was enormously helpful in helping us plan to make the most of our two short days in Tunis, gave us a tutorial and annotated map which were indispensible for navigating the medina, and she made dinner reservations for us as well which was quite helpful. The breakfast was prepared from scratch and featured an array of homemade jams which were superb. We enjoyed meeting other travelers around the breakfast table and the house was quiet in the evening.d"

        "review_text": "We spent a holiday with friends at this hotel. We definitely do not recommend this facility. Although we managed to find an attractive price offer, there are some things that you should not turn a blind eye to. Cleanliness in the room, in the canteen and toilets does not exist. The pool bar is located right next to the stinking public bathrooms, from which a terrible stench is extracted. I feel sorry for the bartenders who spend their days there. Despite leaving tips in the room, it was never cleaned anyway. Food is a failure, monotonous and tasteless, sometimes with a strange, disturbing taste. Whether we came to the opening of the canteen or later - it was always cold. In the cafeteria, mess, sticky tables, leftover food on the floor and tables, all in all everywhere. Sometimes at lunch there were still those from breakfast. Great chaos in the queues for meals, sometimes even fighting for priority. As for the beach at the hotel, it is wide and sandy, with a gentle descent to the sea but unfortunately littered and could easily be cut. The water in the sea was extremely clean but it could not be perfect here either, because on the shore there is a lot of rubbish, probably thrown by the sea. Lots of flip-flops, bottles, filters, foils, etc. Sunbeds on the beach free of charge, if you succeed you can also put a metarac on them, but you have to hunt them because there are fewer of them than sunbeds. The pool at the hotel is a little too small for such a large number of people who can be in the hotel at the same time. Animations mainly for children, we will not judge because we were a group of adults themselves. Plus for the reception staff - very helpful both during the problems with air conditioning and organizing a taxi to a nearby town."

        "review_text": "2 weeks holiday. First week hotel overcrowded with local families with lots of children. The restaurant food was good and varied. The main problem was the dining room with the floor always greasy and slippery like an ice rink. Dirty, greasy tables and chairs. Buffets stormed with no politeness and no respect for queues by local tourists. You had to fight and scramble like in the Far West to reach the food, raided in absurd quantities by local families, who then abandoned it on the tables without being able to consume it because taken in quantities truly beyond imagination. The staff was constantly bringing in new pans of food, but a couple of local customers were enough to empty the whole pan. Small local children ran around the room without any parental control, touching and licking the food and tongs of the buffets. Some local children tasted the sweets and then put them back in the buffet. The European clientele was stunned and could not believe that they had ended up in such a hogwash. The staff, always kind, witnessed what was happening, made us realize that they agreed with us that the situation was crazy, but did not intervene in any way and just watched. After a complaint from us and other Italian customers, the management and the chef admitted that they were not able to cope with the situation, but they gave us their personal willingness to let us have the food personally, which was not necessary because in the second week, probably thanks to the start of school, local families drastically decreased and this made the situation much better and we finally managed to eat with peace of mind managing to access all the available foods. We have been visiting Tunisian hotels for over 30 years, we have always enjoyed it, but we have never been in a similar situation!!! The local customers sitting on the lobby chairs (often soaked in water by those who sat in their costumes still wet) with their bare feet resting on the tables we had never seen them anywhere. I would say that this is an unsuitable structure for European customers if that is always the case."

        "review_text": "Where do I even begin, previously tried to gain contact with the hotel multiple times to find out if they had travel cots available but still didn’t receive any contact, so we arrived to the hotel after a 2hr 13 minute coach journey which we were told it would be 45 minutes max, terrible driver was speeding and had to slam on on a roundabout causing us all to fly forward even my daughter (7months old) which she was left with a bruise at the side of her head, no apology or nothing he knew something was wrong as I shouted and he could hear my daughter cry but when we arrived he had the cheeky to keep asking for a tip. To then I told he would not receive because of his driving. (EasyJet’s driver) (Not the hotels fault but share my experience) we went to the lobby and asked to fill out some forms (I.e address, profession, passport information) and pay holiday tax to stay at the hotel which worked out to be £7.03 for 7 nights pp which we was never made aware off.  Got to the room to find out they are dusty and smell musty, cot it’s self was dirty as we clean it with antibacterial wipes turned black( pictured). Light in the bathroom are very dull and needs more, tiles have been destroyed and put back together like a child has done it.   There is no kettle or mini fridge in the rooms, shower was broken till the 3rd day of our stay, Ants are literally everywhere in the room place you wouldn’t think they could get too. The rooms need a small pan and brush as the floor is always full of sand and crap. In the rooms you can hear everything next door, upstairs,  in the corridor and even the entertainment which is really loud   The hotel was good and okay till the 3rd when the 900 Arab locals over the week (This is what the staff called them) turned up. I have never met so many rude, dirty guests in my life, they walk and barge into you even tho we had a pram with a 7 month old, look you up and down in discuss and literally leave no food for anyone else they stack there plates high and waste so much food plates was placed on the floor, food was everywhere. (Pictured). High chair was very dirty and not cleaned once whilst we were there. The staff honestly did their best to help us but it was a struggle. I think the hotel should let other guests know when they are staying and put a maximum scoop allowance, as this literally ruined the holiday  Food is pretty good until you realise the menu doesn’t change on dinner and tea we got sick of eat the same stuff over and over, also they do not cater for the English which is understandable as we was the only English family in the hotel at the time.  We also seen staff filling up water bottles by the “beach bar” (shed) with the sand wash down, no I don’t think that is drinking water, after this we didn’t want to risk getting ill or having D&V and had to buy our own bottled water. (We went all inclusive)  Kids play area/ park had sharp knives objects in we believe these are thorns (see picture) these made our feet bleed and I am an adult never mind a child that run/crawl,roll around this is definitely not acceptable. Only wanted to take my daughter on the swings and I ended up with pinpricks in my foot.  Power cuts & hot water if you came in around 17:30 to 20:00 you would get luke warm water as the pool closed and everyone was getting ready for tea. Power cuts happened a couple of times as we was getting sorted, not a big problem if we didn’t have our daughter.  Beach is really nice apart from fag butts everywhere even though there is a bin 6foot away from every sun lounge (not the hotels fault but machine to sort this would help) and there is a shaft/tent with paragliding, jet skis, dingy and much more prices are reasonable.  There is a bank/exchange and a shop with the hotel complex so you do not have to leave which is great but I would recommend bring your own currency as you would have to travel out the hotel to a cash machine (5 minutes car journey)  Camel ride guy within the hotel sold us tickets which cost us roughly 30 quid each we got picked up from the hotel to the camels and literally went in a big circle (can still see where we got on the camels) waited an hour on top on hill to look at “views” then back down to have naan bread and spicy sauce as food. I honestly would say it’s not worth over £15 quid max especially when 10 of us did it. Just be careful as he does mix with the truth.  The Entertainment is really REALLY good here honestly can’t fault them at-all even though we was the only English there and the locals wanted nothing to do with us, they tried their best to get us involved as much as possible. No matter what they would always have activities on every 2 hours (water sports, kids club, mini disco) you just can’t fault them, honestly if it wasn’t for the entertainment and the team it would seriously ruin the holiday, This is the only really reason why I would ever visit again.  Staff are very kind and friendly, work very hard.  Overall I’d say this is more like a 2 star on the other hand its sister hotel definitely gets all the money as it was so much more nicer, more staff, cleaner and more Modern. I am only sharing my experience and just to help others know before traveling out and being disappointed."

        "review_text": "Hotel is based about 1.5 hrs from Airport so not a problem for us. Just be aware of that when you go there as different times are given by easyjet and also on the bus on way there.   Food is fine however can be very repetitive. Drinks are not good at all. Cocktails are not nice, too sweet.   We stayed a week which was enough as weather was not great last few days and nothing much to do in hotel. Activities are more organised for outside so they should plan inside stuff for the rainier / dull days as can be boring. I got massage for £25 for 45 mins. It was very good.   Overall when we got there I found hotel very clean. You pay tourist tax on arrival which is 8 dinar per day (£2 per day. ) Free WiFi is only really available in reception although I was lucky to get it in my room. Most of the staff are lovely but talking to some reception staff can be hard as felt like I was bothering them. Start of holiday was fine but when italians came the show at 9.30pm was mainly in Italian and barely any English compared to start of week when it was 95% English. I understand that you cater for guests but there were so many English spoken people there and barely any English was spoken at shows. The water was too rough at beach to do anything but beach area was nice along with beach bar for snacks. The pool is freezingggg lol but once you eventually get in, it's absolutely fine and a great pool. Good size. Rooms were comfy but sometimes music from a different hotel goes on to 2/3am and was hard to sleep. The walls are very thin so can hear everything also (even woman snoring in room next to me) . The shower is excellent. Upon check out make sure everything is still in room as one of the glass tumblers was missing from my mums room and they made a fuss of it as we were waiting for our bus to go home. My mum accidentally left it on side table outside with her other glasses she took to room and it was collected. The entertainment team.. My daughter loved them and enjoyed the dancing etc. The shows at night are really good but when weather was bad they should do the shows inside because it was so cold! They moved the show outside when italians came but even had it outside when it was very cold at night. The team did keep energy up every day but when weather was bad they sat round a lot talking to everyone, went around to all tables sitting at least 30 mins each time when they could be arranging things to do indoors and sometimes people just don't want to talk on holiday especially for me as I am introverted and just want to relax.  The area has a few bars and restaurants. The souvenir shop outside security place of hotel is handy to go to, to use leftover dinar and get some snacks.  This is my honest review and I know loads have given it 5 stars this year compared to last year and I do think it is a great hotel and I had a nice time but I just like to be left alone and do my own things and just think energy didn't match mine and that's OK."

        "review_text": "EXCELLENT HOTEL!!  As we my partner and I have previously stayed at this hotel we knew it was a good place to stay...but upon arrival this year the refurbishment of reception area with new lighting and seating was fantastic it's really lightened up the surroundings there.   Then we can talk about the restaurant refurbishment.. again it's been done to very good standard with bright furniture colours and paint  throughout and all new cooking facilities, bain Marie pots ,soup pots ect. Food great and something for all...if you like any sort of egg for breakfast like us ..we took a bottle of hp brown sauce which others liked us to share haha. During our stay we had large cooler cups which were filled when required but a couple of days before our departure signs went on bars stating no large cups could be filled.. but if you order 2 beers and pour your own in its ok... this is not to get drunk before anyone says anything..this is something we've done on other holidays but it wasn't an issue.   There has been a lot of comments with regards to this being an Italian biased hotel.. so here it is for English or other europeans who visit this fabulous hotel.. the Italian bias as people call it is something that guests need to understand.. yes there is an ITALIAN ANIMATION TEAM...this hotel has been selected by an an Italian tourist company called BRAVO.. they are there to ensure there guests are catered for.. Alice and Roberto run there animation team and are good with English..maybe some of younger team are not ...but a couple of simple words bonjorno or ciao will help cross that barrier as they are a great team..then when you are lucky enough to stay here there is an international animation team.. so after Italian presentation of acts or entertainment you get told in English, Dutch, French German by the international animation manager who is also good.. the animation team's in this hotel are brilliant  so come with open mind get involved in darts,  archery, boules ect and have a brilliant time at El borj"

I arrived at lunchtime on Friday and did my usual thing go straight to the spa to have a hammam seaweed scrub  and a massage to get my skin ready for the sun the best 45 English pounds I’ve spent on  a long time my skin feels great. The massage was amazing, and I would highly recommend that you all give it a go. Steam room was awesome  staff attentive and having had massages all over the world this was lovely I asked for relaxing and not to hard as I’ve had medium before and felt like a lump of over kneaded  dough - This one almost sent me to sleep  and I felt amazing after"

        "review_text": "This is going to be a long one  On arrival was greeted with a big smile and a warm welcome, then a £46 holiday tax, which we were not made aware. The hotel foyer was very spacious and comfortable seats all around, the bar area was at the back of the foyer, with doors out on to the veranda Drinks are limited local variety if you wanted anything else there was a small charge, and not self service and small glasses. The veranda had more comfortable seats and tables with large sun umbrellas over, The pool was large with sun-beds all around on the grass (ants were a pain) could always get a sun bed. The rooms were large, and clean ours had a balcony that looked out to the sea and road below, only moan about this is that the balcony had a board that run around the inside that obscured your view when sitting out, yes rooms are dated and need a bit of TLC, floor by bathroom lifted due to bathroom flooding, towels were a bit grey but they were changed daily and clean, we had a fridge but no kettle, Restaurant was clean and service from waiters amazing,  Adam for breakfast and wajdi for our evening meal both were fantastic and looked after us well,  We always found something to eat, not many English dishes but plenty of chicken,  salad, and chips, Breakfast was typical continental hams and cheeses, there was a lady making omelettes, pancakes, fried eggs or doughnut rings, my partner asked for boiled eggs and these were done daily no problem at all Shopping we found a mall with items already labelled and you could go into the shop with no hassle ( right out hotel, first right, left and a little way along also opposite) you could browse and were left alone, found smaller local shops aggressive and rude if you did not buy anything.  Would be return yes for what we paid it was a very relaxed break away"

During the day they have big water areas where you can get water. No kettles in the rooms. The entertainment team are very friendly and helpful and always trying to make effort with all. Mariem was great always got us involved and made us feel welcomed however the hotel needs to spend more money for entertainment. No live evening performances and during the days limited entertainment. Ramy was also great, very welcoming too and always came to see if we needed anything. Thank you both for making us feel so welcome."

        "review_text": "Just got back from 7 days All Inclusive. This is our honest review based on the price we paid £350pp.   Hotel Very nice,  basic and quiet. Beautiful lobby. Nice pool.  Always found a sun-lounger no problem. Yes the rooms/toilets could do with an upgrade… but… for the price we paid, we didn’t mind and nothing was dangerous or broken. From what we gather, the hotel was taken over a few years ago and they are gradually doing it up.   Staff Probably the best thing about the hotel. All the staff went above and beyond and were absolutely amazing.  All bar staff, petri, slim, Ahmed…. Chefs… waiters…  they even brought drinks over to our sunbeds Lifeguards! They brought the bed toppers over to our sunbeds for us and lovely to chat too. The cleaners left us pretty designs int he bed and with flowers etc  The bell-man, can’t remember his name but he helped take our suitcases up to our room and we saw him every day, always with a smile, he was so lovely!   Massage The man on the massage booking (can’t remember his name) was lovely.  Had a hot oil massage (smelt like bubblegum) cost £35 for 50mins was really nice !   Food For a 4* hotel this was probably the holiday with the least choice of food we have ever been too. And we were a bit worried after the first dinner. However,, we always found something to eat, big shout out to the pasta man,, we had pasta every night for dinner and he knew exactly how we liked it and cooked it fresh for us. Would’ve liked a bit more of selection for breakfast eg different cereals/strawberry jam and a bigger fruit selection perhaps. But overall was ok :-) The pancakes at the bar at snack time with chocolate and strawberries were AMAZING!!   Entertainment (Tmk) We aren’t ones for joining in daytime activities, we only done darts once. But everyday  the team seemed to do boules & darts.  The tmk entertainment staff were really nice and pleasant and made an effort to talk to us. There seemed to be another entertainments team there aswell (club something) I don’t really know what it was but think it was for the French.   Not much evening entertainment, personally would’ve liked a bit more, but I remember in Morocco they didn’t have much of an evening entertainment line-up either so maybe it’s just they don’t really do much.   Excursions  Can’t remember his name, but the guy in the hotel booked our excursions for us and he was very nice and helpful.  Paid £150 for 2 of us to do quad biking (highly recommend!!!) and horse-riding on the beach (I’d never been on a horse in my life, but loved it)   We also managed to get a camel ride on the beach, we had no money to give him so we just asked to have a photo, and next thing u know.. we were both having a ride on the camel. He asked for money after, I said I told him we had no money and he said don’t worry but then demanded some after.  We only had 20 diner on us so we just  gave him that.   Shopping The medina 5 mins away was great!  The rovers return had great filler steak and the best Sunday roast dinner (pre-book the roast)  A taxi to hammamet city was 15 diner (£3.50) worth a visit and the shop prices here were so much cheaper than the ones near the hotel!  Always haggle prices!  We averagely paid £8-30 for a bag depending on quality  Got lots of goodies cheap. Sunglasses £5 Got a taxi to the Nabeul  Friday market at 8:30am, cost 30 diner , really good!  If you love cats as much as I do, I’d probably recommend not looking down the side streets , I saw tiny day old kittens getting stood on and kicked by people and it was heart breaking, I had to take time out of the market to compose myself as I just couldn’t stop crying, it was heart breaking! We also saw chickens get picked and about to be.. well.. you know… and also cows heads.. so definitely not for the faint hearted.  But definitely an eye opener as to how they live in Tunisia.  Overall, would we stay here again. Yes!  (If we got it for the same price again) it was worth the price we paid for a cheap getaway where everyone was so nice and everything was good."

        "review_text": "We got here in time for lunch, standard fayre for A/I, (buffet style) which was fine for us, as we can eat just about anything. And if you like liver and fish, you will be in heaven. The food could be a little warmer. It was all cooked well, just not as hot as we would prefer it to be. Omelettes/crepes and dough nuts made fresh in the morning.  Always something on the griddle for lunch and dinner.  **Try and use the same waiter as they will make sure you have a table with your drinks at meal times. It did get a little busy as the week went on.** Shown to the room by a bell boy, who was knowledgeable and saw to our needs.  Room was fine with our sea view. Although the street/road noise was audible, can put that down to being on the 1st floor. The housekeeping ladies were in every day to change towels and make up room.  Our smoke alarm in the room was faulty, and after 3 goes at trying to fix this, ended up being disconnected. (I had to sign a waiver stating that this would be OK). There are notices saying they are 'upgrading the alarms' and to notify reception if your alarm isn't working, or working too much.  **Lobby/Terrace bar and staff were just the best and in no way could we fault them, and went over and above to accommodate us. These guys were engaging, took interest and are a credit to the hotel.** Pool bar was fine, we didn't use it that much.  Snack bar in the afternoon was a bit hit and miss, when we did use it everything was freshly made and tasty.  Although the animation team were out and about, we weren't that interested, they did seem to be busy enough and they did try to engage us in their activities. Night time entertainment, we didn't go to. So can't comment on that.  **Now the Spa - JUST GO + BOOK IT! It may be a bit more expensive than what you're used to paying, but boy is it worth it! Was so good we went back on the last day! The girls are professional and took notice if you had an area that was tender.**  Photographers were around the hotel most days and nights, if that's your thing.  The WiFi was a bit hit and miss in our room, although speaking to others, theirs was fine. In the lobby/pool areas the signal was better.  Would I go back? Most definitely!"

        "review_text": "To escape if you like cleanliness!! Dilapidated rooms and cleaning not done, we arrived in a dirty room! We changed rooms three times. An embarrassment to a so-called 4-star hotel! Very strong bleach smell mixed with moisture, many return trips to the reception with slow elevators because the room card does not work after a while (forced to go back through the reception to re-magnetize it). The food was not up to our taste, but it remains subjective! Others liked it, it takes something for everyone. Non-subjective reviews: dilapidated rooms and shameful cleaning. The facilitators are very kind and do what they can, but we haven’t seen any daytime entertainment. Maybe in May it is quieter... We arrived on the wrong weekend because many locals were there and it was clearly a mess! It’s not the hotel’s fault, though. What is the fault of the hotel is the cleanliness, the problems of elevators, room cards, the handle of the door of our room that remained in the hand, the rust in the bathroom, the flooring horribly laid, the simply disgusting floor in our room! The hotel has not been sufficiently renovated for a 4 star! A slice of pizza as a taste for all inclusive is very light too... A review remains subjective, people less looking at cleanliness will tell you that it is a superb hotel and other people like us will really not be happy! It’s up to you to see but big downside on the cleanliness of the rooms and the renovation of the rooms that is far from finished! The hosts and Ahmed very nice, the hostess of the reception very nice at first, but in the end it got worse... We will not go back to this hotel!"

        "review_text": "What can you say about this hotel? First impressions are lovely. We got there had to wait two hours for our rooms. The rooms are very old and dirty. Me and my friends stayed here for two weeks. We had one lot of clean towels and our beds was changed once  the whole time we were there my room never got cleaned but they cleaned the balcony which I could never understand. it had one bar open and are limited drinks I asked for bottled water to take to my room on many occasions. I was told no. There was no snack bar in the day they put a tray of food by the bar. there’s no fridges hairdryers in the rooms. It is nothing like the pictures on the Internet all entertainment is done in the nightclub where people are smoking and children do their mini disco. It’s absolutely disgusting. It’s not disabled friendly and if you find steps hard to go up and down this place is full of them and if you complain about anything, you don’t get anywhere it says all inclusive but it’s not because you’ve got to pay extra mattresses for the sunbeds are five dinar a day that’s by the pool and on the beach the bar by reception, you have to pay for drinks if you want to have a drink there. Most of the staff are nice some of them are really rude they asked you for cigarettes. Even the guards on the gates asked you to get them cigarettes when you go out of the gates to go to the shop. We were sat by the pool there was work going on they were painting doing things round the pool. It wasn’t a relaxing holiday. The entertainment team are really good. The only thing is there’s a few of them that spend all their time pestering young girls which isn’t very nice to see. I would not recommend this hotel. It’s the worst hotel I’ve been to in Tunisia."

We checked in just after 11pm and was taken to our room we have 4 bed and a flat screen to with a balcony. Room was clean only had to ask for towels. Next morning went for breakfast and the omelette was amazing. Coffee machine was awsum. The staff in restaurant was always on the go any wanted to please everyone. They set up a lovly table and made a cake for my hubby's bday which was lovly  Pool side always clean The beach was amazing Food was good Staff polite If only 2 things I think they should improve on would be more variety of drink on the all inclusive And more entertainment especially around pool area.   Also think there should be free ice cream for people during the day.   Other than that had an amazing time would decfo recommend for a budget holiday. I will deffo be re visiting.   Thanks caren and Charlie"

We are all tired & stressed by this time !! When we came back they had sorted out rooms for us 🤣 well if that’s what you can call them !! They were dark and dingy smelled of smoke and damp we were all split up all over the complex!! No wifi in any rooms only the club !! Which was an inconvenience as we couldn’t contact anyone!! We complained about the rooms and miraculous they found us 4 rooms all together!! They we expecting a 2 year old to sleep on a bunkbed with a hard tiled floor no offer of a cot !! No fridges in rooms to keep drinks cold !! And the rooms & tvs very dated and didn’t work properly nothing like the brouchures  advertising the hotel !! The food was diabolical it was meant to be multiple choice it was repetitive and vile !! We asked for water on more then on occasion and got refused until we complained!! Especially as you have to use the water to clean your teeth etc !! We got told we were drinking to much !! The whole complex was a disaster from start to finish !! The entertainment of an evening was in a carpeted room and you could smoke in there it was disgusting 🤢 all inclusive means you offer food throughout the day this was not the case !! There was a limited bar too !! Beer wine of vodka nothing else unless you complained!! Definitely a waste of money we will not be going back!!!"

        "review_text": "The worst holiday we have had!  To start when we arrived it took over an hour to check in to then be told they need to find the rooms we booked. We were then told to go eat while they did this.   We go to our rooms where we were far away from each other. When going into the room it smelt of damp, they were filthy. It hadn’t been cleaned it looked like someone had used the bath, the pictures when booking look nothing like what we was given, in one of our friends rooms there was mould in a bedside table. We then got given rooms as near each other after complaining. In the new rooms one of the showers was broke and was still filthy.   The food choice is very limited and repetitive. Barely edible and always cold.   We paid for all inclusive and was refused water on more than one occasion after complaining and telling them I will be posting this all online they have basically tried to bribe us they made us a table with a birthday cake and on another night they made us a table with a bottle of vodka and nibbles as one of our party posted a poor review.   Half of the amenities were closed, the ‘club’ where they did the entertainment was filthy and just smelt of smoke. There was live light wires just hanging out the wall. We asked for our rep to come to the hotel and he didn’t even bother showing up.   On one of the evenings a 2 year old shut himself in a room and they didn’t want to know, it took them over 30 mins to even open the door.   In one of the rooms there were bugs in the beds and all over the floor.  There is no wifi in the rooms, only in the reception.  They ran out of glasses and were giving drinks out in small paper coffee cups. There’s live wires sticking out the ground and walls. They have slides here and told us they are under construction but another worker told us they don’t even have a license for them.  Management really needs to look into the poor reviews as it is diabolical here.  It really is not worth the money to come here.  I’m awaiting a response on getting a refund."

        "review_text": "First thing we see in the room was the toilet leaking always making noise, the tv didn’t work and the balcony door didn’t close all the way.  So they moved us to a different room and this room was not much better. The rooms in the photos on the website are completely different to the rooms we have seen. They say it’s all inclusive but you have to pay for icecream and sunbeds. And if you want to play football in the courts you have to pay.  The bar there was so poor that you had to walk all the way down to the main bar just to get a drink, because they don’t want to open the bar up at the pool yet. And the drinks you have come in a little plastic cup like I’m a kid.  The food here was not the best, most nights we had to eat out, just so we could eat. We fully understand traditional food, but there’s kids and people with various allergies etc, typical simplistic food would have safised.  When the cleaner come in to clean the room they moved all of are clothes around. Like don’t touch my stuff.  Overall, not satisfied and won’t be returning the pictures used on various holiday websites of the hotel/rooms etc  are very deceiving.  Slides aren’t open due to not having a license for it which isn’t stated prior to coming, why show them if you cannot use them?"

However, to my pleasant surprise, the interior of the hotel and its overall ambiance were truly exceptional. As the saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover,\" and that certainly proved to be true in this case.  The staff’s treatment was wonderful starting from the reception to the security personnel. A particularly outstanding aspect was the presence of Miss Amira, who is in charge of guest relations. She possesses a refined cultural, marketing, and social sensibility that clearly distinguishes her in her role.  I highly recommend everyone to visit this elegant hotel without hesitation.

This year the food although traditional Tunisian as always was by far better than last year which is great. The hotel rooms are basic but perfectly suitable, the water is hot and the rooms cleaned everyday.  The whole hotel is constantly being cleaned and maintenance staff always doing stuff within the grounds. The activities available tennis courts, basketball, beach volleyball etc. The animation team are pleasant and very engaging ask people to get involved with activities of which they try and do things all day.  The evening entertainment was the same as last year everyday something different but after 7 days they repeat again and it hasn’t changed a lot since last year which was a little disappointing but won’t stop us visiting again. The staff of the hotel are second to none always looking to please, the bar staff are great and we have made a few holiday friends for life in a lot of the staff.  We will definitely be returning next year. It may be a 3 star hotel but has 5 star elements"

There are shops that are a 5 minute walk from the hotel if needing essentials etc. We got a tunisian sim card which was 42 dinar for 25gb of data so you don't need to use your UK sim as can be costly. The bar staff will bring your drinks to you whilst your at the pool which I thought was great! The staff are very helpful and polite including the waiters etc. Food here for us was excellent and reached above my expectations for a 3 star. If your looking for chips, chicken nuggets then don't book here as everything is traditional food. They have a pasta station and a pizza station if you can't find anything to eat. Desserts are lovely and for us we enjoyed the food. I can't fault this place and I'm sad to leave. Alot of the guests we met have booked 9-10 days here. There are jet skis and paragliding on the beach if you want to do some water sports. We went out for dinner a couple of times to the hard rock cafe which is a bit like TGIS and have entertainment there also. Its a 10 minute walk from the hotel. No issues or problems whilst we have been here and I would definitely recommend if your looking for a cheap getaway. Please do not book if your looking for 5 star with a 3 star budget! Good value for money!"

Never seen him the whole holiday. Food was mostly inedible.. and mostly not warm. The cleanliness of the dinning room was not great, out of date hygiene certificate on display. Staff , it was a 50/50 split between nice and grumpy. I know id deffo be grumpy working there. Even shop keepers in near by shops said it was the worst place, that they only open for season and close again, they don't put money back into the hotel or area. Has totally put me off the country and dont think I will return. Which if every body done this would not be good for tourism in Tunisia. Only good bit was the beach, it was beautiful"

The Pension is perfect. The food is good but always the same especially when you stay 15 days. The private beach is really not possible the same on the whole coast around the Pension you have to go further on Nabeul. Big black spot when you are with children, really a shame especially when you see that some employees throw their cigarettes on the sidewalks when they should respect the place for their customers. Really hard to have clean places around. Suitable for the Award."

In terms of parking, don't expect us to have space easily, the popular places are reserved for the boss's colleagues who come to drink in the evening ;).. No wifi in the rooms, that’s true! And French channels yes but only 4 or 5. A LOT of noise, people don't respect anything, speak loudly, slam doors violently and often and we were extremely lucky to have work done above our room! 👍🏻 It's a 3 shooting star hotel, I've spent better nights in ibises in France which don't have any stars.."

        "review_text": "Disgusting and dirty. The cleaners sat in my balcony while I was down in the pool. My credentials were in the room and anything could have been taken. Not recommended! When you talk to the manager, he says that they would clean and then I said that it was my check-out in about an hour and it was not professional to sit in my balcony and look out at the pool."

        "review_text": "This hotel is filthy and run down. The staff are very friendly and want to make you feel welcome, but they have nothing to work with. The pictures are not representative of what is there. The patio door was unlockable, clearly been forced. The bedding dirty. Some sheets had blood on them. Cracked tiles on the floor and in the bathroom and the tap ran brown water. The beach was desolate, dirty and the beach hut a now broken down uncared for shell, to get to it you would have to cross a stretch of land littered with rubbish and occupied by stray dogs. There is more, but this should be enough to stop you going."

        "review_text": "I stayed at the Byzance in May of this year for 6 nights. I arrived late at night and was shown my room, it was a sea facing room which I thought was ok.  Until daylight hit and I could see the mess. The land behind the hotel was not very picturesque but looked more like a dumping ground. A few locals lived here but didn't seem to keep it tidy.  The only good thing about the view was the stray cats, 13 in total that I counted, to which I ended up spending my days feeding and watering them.  They made my holiday, as there was literally nothing else to do here.  The hotel pool was freezing cold and to uncomfortable to swim in, so sitting on the edge was as far as I managed lol.  Luckily only had a couple of really hot days whilst there.   The hotel itself wasn't up to much, nothing like the pictures it advertises, nothing to do in the evenings, no entertainment as such, a man and a keyboard playing the same songs every night.  Nothing i wanted to sit and listen to night after night and he played late into the night which was loud and annoying when trying to sleep. My room was on the 1st floor, which luckily got changed on the night I arrived from the 3rd floor, the night time manager was kind enough to give me the choice of rooms, which I was grateful for.  Even back in May the lift wan't working so after reading recent reviews I don't believe it ever has worked. I used the hamman whilst there I had a lovely massage from the lady who was lovely, she was friendly and tried her hardest to speak english, we managed to have a laugh at least.   The food, what can I say, it was mostly edible, chicken n fish almost every meal, and liver, blurrrrrrr, hate the stuff and it was served most days, but at least the cats liked it haha.   For some reason this hotels bar/cafe was very popular with the local men, who would sit for hours with their coffee n cake smoking and watching the female guests, very unnerving.  But the lobby bar was clean n tidy at all times. The All-Inclusive bar however was not, it was run down and dirty behind the bar, could do with a good clean up and maybe some new fridges. The Wifi however was only accessible from the lobby, it barely reached the rooms or out by the pool. Apart from all the above I had a pleasant stay, I was looking for a relaxing holiday and thats what I got, simply because there was nothing to do there. no trips where offered to me, some people went on a boat trip which they said was ok but the sea was freezing cold.  Would have liked to have gone into Hammamet but never got round to it. All in all I wouldn't recommend Nabeul as a holiday destination, or The Byzance hotel. Go to Hammamet or Yasmine Hammamet as I've heard their more geared up for the traveller.  This is not my first visit to Tunisia, I've been to Port El Kantaoui before and loved it there, the Tunisian people are wonderful and friendly I hope the country can recover from the past atrocity that happened that very sad day on the beach.    Last but not least anyone travelling to The Byzance Hotel please look after the cats out the back, they rely on the holiday makers to feed them, some are brave enough to even come into the hotel grounds and restaurant looking for food, the others however live in the tree out back and never come down. I found if I threw food from my balcony onto the roof of the house they actually got fed."

        "review_text": "This hotel is horrible, It matches nothing to the description. The spa for the hamam was closed during the full two weeks of staying there. As soon as we landed we had to wait 1and half hours to get our family room. We weren’t shown around the hotel no one assisted us with taking our luggage up. The lift had gotten stuck whilst inside it. We finally got used to getting around the hotel. The only good thing about the hotel was the cleanliness around, the cleaners were good at doing there jobs. Some of the staff were lovely. However some of the staff were very very rude...I mean I’ve been to better three star hotels. We requested a fridge and paid for it and received it a whole week after renting it out. We then received it and the plug wouldn’t fit due to the size of the fridge. The fridge was absolutely disgusting. The rooms are not child friendly there are many health and safety hazards. The electrics are hanging down from the phone there’s cracks in the floor tiles. The door has no lock on the terrace. I can not stress how much of a rubbish hotel this place is!!! If your going on holiday with children this is not the place to stay. Tunisia is a beautiful place and in fact it’s my 7th time staying in Tunisia but this hotel is absolutely disgusting. There’s no entertainment for the children. It’s just not a hotel you’d want to stay at. The food is terrible everything about it is just horrible."
