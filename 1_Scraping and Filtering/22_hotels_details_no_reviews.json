    "description": "The Russelia also called Coral-Plant or Fountain-Plant is a member of the Scropphulariacea family. This plant has several branched out and quadrangular, more or less drooping and fairly intertwined, stalks. Its leaves are elongated and oval-shaped. It is an original plant, of an attractive green colour that looks fresh throughout the year. Russelia blossoms from spring to the end of the summer. Its flowers are clustered into a loose bunch at the end of long slender peduncles. They are small-sized and bear a tubular corolla. The plant thus seems to be covered with a galaxy of scarlet small bells. Why The Russelior ? From a wedding between the Rareness and Delicateness of a flower that grows in altitude, in Northern Tunisia The “Russelia”, and the Nobleness and Beauty of the most precious among metals: “Gold”. The “Russelior” is born.Read more",
